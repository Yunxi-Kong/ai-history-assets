## The Creation of This Book

This textbook was created as part of the Interactive OER for Dual
Enrollment project, facilitated by [LOUIS: The Louisiana Library
Network](https://louislibraries.org) and funded by a \$2 million [Open
Textbooks Pilot Program grant from the Department of
Education](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/otp/index.html).

This project supports the extension of access to high-quality
post-secondary opportunities to high school students across Louisiana
and beyond by creating materials that can be adopted for dual enrollment
environments. Dual enrollment is the opportunity for a student to be
enrolled in high school and college at the same time.

The cohort-developed OER course materials are released under a license
that permits their free use, reuse, modification and sharing with
others. This includes a corresponding course available
in [MoodleNet ](https://moodle.net/collection/B5sLJvhg/world-civilization-i)and [Canvas
Commons](https://lor.instructure.com/resources/cb6fa817a3374811ae956ddead3dc523) that
can be imported to other Learning Management System platforms. For
access/questions, contact [Affordable Learning
Louisiana](mailto:%20alearningla@laregents.edu).

If you are adopting this textbook, we would be glad to know of your use
via this [brief
survey](https://survey.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_41Olbogjof6HUay).

## Review Statement

This textbook and its accompanying course materials went through at
least two review processes:

- Peer reviewers, coordinated by Jared Eusea, River Parish Community
  College, used an online course development standard rubric for
  assessing the quality and content of each course to ensure that the
  courses developed through Interactive OER for Dual Enrollment support
  online learners in that environment. The evaluation framework reflects
  a commitment to accessibility and usability for all learners.
  - Reviewers
    - Steven Schwamenfeld
    - Anne Branscum
    - Catherine Doyle

<!-- -->

- The Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education
  (ISKME) collaborated with LOUIS to review course materials and ensure
  their appropriateness for dual enrollment audiences.  Review criteria
  were drawn from factors that apply across dual enrollment courses and
  subject areas, such as determining appropriate reading levels,
  assessing the fit of topics and examples for high school DE students;
  applying high-level principles for quality curriculum design,
  including designing for accessibility, appropriate student knowledge
  checks, and effective scaffolding of student tasks and prior knowledge
  requirements, addressing adaptability and open educational practices,
  and principles related to inclusion and representational social
  justice.

> .footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"}

The above case of Florida State geologist Elias Sellards demonstrates
that the study of "human antiquity" or man's earliest origins is one
surrounded by passion, controversy, and a deep well of curiosity. Our
curiosity about our earliest origins has not only given birth to
fictional characters like Indiana Jones and Captain Kirk but also is
largely responsible for the growth of archaeology in the early twentieth
century. Western scholars and explorers were not content with simply
reaching remote places; they were curious about their earliest human
inhabitants. While the motives of early excavators may have been quite
simple (well-known paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey got his start
collecting stones as a child), archaeologists and paleoanthropologists
eventually created an entirely new field of historical investigation:
prehistory. Multiple pioneers have hacked through underbrush or spent
months excavating **Paleolithic** sites. Not until recently, however,
have scientific advances, local knowledge, and anthropological theory
merged with the curiosity of Western explorers to craft a more accurate
version of human origins and evolution.

Written texts are the primary sources most historians are trained to
work with and are those they are most comfortable using. However, if we
are to understand humanity's origins, we have to recognize that written
language is a relatively recent invention (around 5,000 years old);
therefore, much of what we know about human beginnings must be borrowed
from the findings of colleagues in other disciplines like geology,
botany, and archaeology. In all of the regions mentioned below,
archaeologists have excavated and analyzed physical evidence relating to
our prehistoric ancestors. Up until recent times, though, it was
difficult to understand migration patterns and chronology without a
method to determine the age of anything from a human skull to a cutting
tool. Archaeologists in the 1930s and '40s used imprecise terms like
"stone bowl cultures," a nomenclature that referred more to the details
of the articles unearthed than their historical context. This began to
change with the advent of radiocarbon dating or C14 dating in the 1940s.
Through this method, we were able to place thousands of organic
archaeological materials in their proper historical context even without
textual
evidence.[^\[2\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-2 "J. E. G Sutton, “Archeology and Reconstructing History in the Kenya Highlands: The Intellectual Legacies of G. W. B. Huntingford and Louis S. B. Leakey,” History in Africa 34, (2007): 313."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"} For artifacts over 40,000 years old,
the amount of radioactive carbon we can recover doesn't permit accurate
measurement. However, we do have a number of techniques to trace human
origins even further back, including aerial photography, side-scanning
radar, and potassium-argon dating. All these techniques get around the
lack of radioactive carbon in that they don't date the organic material
but instead the terrain in which they were found, allowing us to trace
human origins back millions of years to the beginnings of bipedalism.

The goal of this chapter, though, is not to trace human evolution from
its beginnings but to set the scene for the beginnings of civilization.
In this chapter, we will explore why hominids moved, how they survived,
and how they came to develop agriculture. We also hope to lay out why
humans in far-flung parts of the world responded similarly to changing
conditions around them and hence developed civilizations at roughly the
same time.

This chapter begins at the origins of bipedalism some eight million
years ago and brings us up to eight thousand years ago with the
**Neolithic** era or "new stone age." Bipedal hominids would develop
during the Pliocene era and our closest ancestors during the more recent
**Pleistocene**. Finally, modern ***Homo sapiens*** would appear during
the **Holocene**. During the **Holocene** humans would perfect tool
usage during the **Paleolithic** era and would usher in agriculture
during the Neolithic. Our chapter ends as humans prepare to enter the
Bronze and Iron Ages.

## 1.5 HUMAN BEGINNINGS IN AFRICA

The fossil record in Africa clearly establishes that a human lineage
diverged there from African apes sometime between eight and six million
years ago. Beginning as far back as eight million years ago, various
species of hominids (the ancestors of modern humans or *Homo sapiens*)
began to walk upright. This bipedalism would allow these hominids to use
their hands to develop, craft, and use tools. Bipedalism would also
eventually contribute to a move out of forests into the savanna and turn
hominids into big game hunters and gatherers. Paleoanthropologists once
theorized that hominids became bipedal to adapt to life in the
grasslands. However, the fact that fossils of bipedal hominids were
found alongside fossil remains of wood, seeds, and other forest dwellers
has cast some doubt on that theory. In fact, bipedal hominids may have
lived in the forest for some time. While some bipedal hominids may have
stayed in the forest, climate changes did drive others to move into new
areas within Africa and beyond it.

### 1.5.1 Climate, Hominin in Evolution, and Migrations

As far as thirty million years ago, hominids were reacting to changes in
their environment. ("Hominids" refers to all Great Apes, including
humans and their ancestors. "Hominins" is often used when speaking more
specifically about modern humans and their more recently extinct
ancestors. We will use "hominids" here because it covers all of the
groups we will reference, including modern humans.) The earth cooled,
producing more fragmented environments. As already mentioned, some
hominids may have stayed in the trees, but those that left the forest
began to thrive in grasslands. These savannas and prairies expanded
during the Miocene, the geologic era lasting from 24 to 2 million years
ago. This grassland expansion prompted baboons and hominids to move out
of the forest.

During the Pliocene epoch (5--1.6 million years ago), another series of
environmental changes made these grasslands even more prevalent, leading
to a transformation that geologists call the "turnover-pulse
hypothesis." Animals with adaptations such as angled knee joints and
arched feet survived on the grasslands, while those with longer arms or
curved fingers who were better suited to the woodlands did not. For
hominids, this favorable grassland environment meant the "development of
several closely related species. Large-toothed hominids known as robust
australopithecines appeared in Southern and Eastern
Africa."[^\[3\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-3 "J. E. G Sutton, “Archeology and Reconstructing History in the Kenya Highlands: The Intellectual Legacies of G. W. B. Huntingford and Louis S. B. Leakey,” History in Africa 34, (2007): 313."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-3
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 3"} Towards the end of the Pliocene,
around 2.4 million years ago, the first members of our genus---*homo*
(***Homo habilis***)---appeared, the first hominid to make stone tools.

The **Pleistocene** epoch (1.6 million--10,000 years ago) saw at least
twenty-five periods of glaciation and warming. Glaciation resulted from
dips in global temperature which had two major effects on hominid
development. First, with sea levels dropping due to glaciation, hominids
migrated to Australia and the Americas for the first time. Second, while
many migrated out of colder climates, those that remained developed
physical adaptations. *Homo neanderthalensis* (Neanderthals), a hominid
that disappeared 28,000 years ago, became stockier and more powerful to
deal with the difficulties of this icy climate.

While not as dramatic as previous developments, the current **Holocene**
period (beginning 11,700 years ago) has seen its share of significant
climatic events. The Younger Dryas event (c. 11,000 BCE) was a drop in
global temperatures accompanied by a corresponding change in vegetation
distribution. Reduced rainfall from 2200 to 1900 BCE made conditions
very difficult for civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean. Finally,
the Medieval Warm Period represents "one of the most recent periods of
climate
change."[^\[4\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-4 "Ibid., 3-5."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-4
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 4"} Like *neanderthalensis,* ***Homo
sapiens****,* ***Homo erectus****,* ***Homo habilis***, and other
hominids all reacted to changing climate conditions. *Homo erectus and
Homo habilis* migrated, hunted, and used fire, while *neanderthalensis*
had some use of language and tools and buried their dead. For millions
of years, in fact, hominids had been using slivers of volcanic stone and
cutters probably to hack through animal skin. The cutters were often
found close together, suggesting that early hominids even had a division
of labor between hunters who would have to pursue their prey and
butchers who could wait nearby at the butchering site. There is even
evidence of task division by gender among *neanderthalensis*. Multiple
sites in Europe show different patterns of wear on male and female
teeth, indicating a gendered task division in tasks where teeth were
used to hold, break, or strip
objects.[^\[5\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-5 "Almudena Estalrrich and Antonio Rosas, “Division of Labor by Sex and Age in Neandertals: An Approach Through the Study of Activity-Related Dental Wear,” Journal of Human Evolution 80, (March 2015): 51-63."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-5
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 5"}

However, by 25,000 years ago, all other hominins were extinct; only
*Homo sapiens sapiens*, our species, survived. Paleoanthropologists
attribute this survival to larger brains, durability, and the ability to
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Based on migration patterns
and archaeological evidence, *Homo sapiens sapiens* appear to have been
the only hominids to build sea-worthy boats, create art, have organized
religion, and live in any
climate.[^\[6\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-6 "Ristvet, 24-26."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-6
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 6"}

### 1.5.2 *Homo sapiens* Migration

While *Homo sapiens* were decidedly more advanced than other hominids,
when they first moved out of Africa some 45,000 years ago, they were
only equipped with stone tools for hunting and cutting. Despite those
initial limitations, 30,000 years later, *Homo sapiens* would inhabit
almost every environment on earth and had a presence in every continent
except Antarctica. *Homo sapiens* in fact moved further and faster than
all other hominids. While it is hard to attribute a single factor to all
*Homo sapiens* migration, we do see that multiple human societies
required migration to arrive at a more sophisticated level of
development. *Homo sapiens* migration accelerated close to 40,000 years
ago, when humans reached continental Eurasia.

Modern humans (52,000--12,000 years ago) completed the migration to all
the continents except Antarctica, moving first into Australia, Eastern
Siberia, the Pacific margins, Japan, and the Americas. Then from 10,000
years ago to 1,500 CE, humans arrived in the Arctic, the Indian Ocean,
the deep Pacific, and tropical rain forests. Migration occurred in a
"staccato" pattern, with "easiest" areas colonized quickly, while more
"difficult" areas remained uninhabited for thousands of years. A
region's "easiness" is calculated from estimates about available plant
and animal biomass and net productivity---that is, how quickly it
returns---in each habitat. For example, tropical savannas and grasslands
of East Africa were colonized first, as the biomass there sustained the
first bipedal hominids.

Hominids first left "sub-Saharan Africa ... through the northern
savannahs, up the Nile corridor or across the straits of Bab el Mandeb
to the Arabian
Peninsula."[^\[7\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-7 "Clive Gamble, Timewalkers: Prehistory of Global Colonization (Bath, Avon: The Bath Press, 1993), 125-128."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-7
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 7"} Evidence exists of *Homo erectus* in
Morocco, Chad, and Algeria, and it appears that they eventually left
Africa via the Arabian Peninsula. After leaving Africa about 1.5 million
years ago, choppers, hand axes, and spheroids found at sites like
Ubeidiya in Israel put *Homo erectus* in the Levant. Some scholars argue
for the existence of a second migration out of Africa and into the
Jordan Valley 500 to 600 thousand years ago.

#### Asia

Some evidence suggests the presence of *Homo ergaster* and *Homo
erectus* as having occurred in Java over a million years ago. Chinese
*Homo erectus* fossils date between 800,000 and 400,000 years ago. *Homo
sapiens* began to leave Africa around 40,000 years ago, and
hunter-gatherers appeared in China by the end of the last **Ice Age**
(36,000 to 16,000 BCE) as continental ice in central Asia began to melt.

#### Europe

Animal bones and pebble tools place hominids near Rome just before the
beginning of the Middle **Pleistocene** (730,000 years ago). This seems
to be the first hominid incursion into Europe. Hominid remains in Spain
suggest colonization in Iberia up to two million years ago, but there
are not nearly enough remains (no more than twenty inhabitants in any
given site) to provide any certainty in terms of which hominids they
correspond to or when they lived there. Either way, colonization of
Europe can be considered "late." This tardiness may have been related to
a lack of animal food sources. Not until around 500,000 years ago did
"new species of deer, bovid, rhino, and horse
appear"[^\[8\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-8 "Ibid., 135."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-8
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 8"} in Europe. Around the same time, the
cheetah, saber-tooth tiger, and dirk-tooth cat declined in the region,
making more carcasses from the aforementioned species available to
hominid foragers.

#### Australia, Papua New Guinea, Sahul

Evidence of tools from 30,000 years ago exists in Australia, and from
even longer in New Guinea. The lack of "a dry land crossing to Sahul"
(the landmass that once connected New Guinea and Australia) meant that
an ocean journey of somewhere between 65 and 100 kilometers was required
from mainland Asia. This made Australians and New Guineans the first
sea-going colonizers. Once in Sahul, how humans populated Australia is
still the subject of some debate between those who support the "coastal
hugger" theory and those who support the idea of population by
"overlanders." The more difficult of the two means of populating
Australia is overland, as it is more arid than the coasts, and the
evidence for tools overland is not as advanced as that for the coast.

#### Peopling the New World

North and South America were the last continents to be settled by
humans. Most scholars think that the Americas were populated from
**Beringia** over land. Around 12,000 years ago, mammoth hunting became
more common and supported larger populations on both the Asian and
American sides of **Beringia**, a landmass (now divided by the Bering
Strait) which at that time connected North America and Asia. On the
Asian side, outlines of houses with stone-lined hearths have been found,
remnants indicating permanent settlement that didn't necessarily have
colonization as an end goal. But colonize they did, one group pushing
southward between 10,000 and 3,000 years ago and establishing
settlements that would become the origins of modern Korean, Japanese,
Chinese, and Inuit populations. Another group migrated southeastward
through Alaska, their descendants making it as far as Chile and
Argentina.

While we know about when American colonization began, the pace and means
of colonization are still debated. Complicating the discussion of timing
is the fact that the Late Wisconsin Ice sheet blocked the overland route
from about 30,000 years ago, when two sheets merged, up until about
12,000 years ago, when they opened after a thaw. At this point in time,
only a handful of sites support possible pre-10,000 BCE occupation:
Monte Verde in Chile, Meadowcraft near Pittsburgh, and Page-Ladson in
Florida. As recently as 2015, excavations at Monte Verde and
Chinchihuapi have strengthened the "possibility of an earlier human
presence on the continent" to as far back as 17,000 BCE. This date has
continued to move back in time as archeologists consider evidence of
more mobile humans who did not leave large artifact clusters because of
their ephemeral nature but nonetheless may have been present before more
sedentary groups.

For now, however, the clearest evidence for when the Americas were
widely populated comes through the Clovis point, a specific arrowhead
shape that was unique in its ubiquity and sophistication. The Clovis
point was also found in mammoths that had grown extinct by 10,500 years
ago, this discovery meaning that humans were common in North America by
then. From Beringia, humans moved at a rate of roughly 10 miles a year
until they reached Tierra del Fuego and fully populated the Americas
(with the exception of some tropical areas mentioned
above).[^\[9\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-9 "Dillehay TD, Ocampo C, Saavedra J, Sawakuchi AO, Vega RM, Pino M, et al.

.footnote aria-label="Footnote 9"}

#### The Arctic

The first Paleo-Eskimo populations appeared around 4,000 years ago after
arriving from Eastern Siberia, populations that were left behind by the
American colonists already mentioned. The Arctic climate is harsh, to
say the least, and these populations needed sophisticated weapons and
tools to be able to survive it, which explains their late arrival.

The Arctic colonists expanded rapidly across Alaska, through Canada, and
into Greenland, assisted by their arctic "small tool kits" that included
the important toggle-headed harpoons to kill walrus and seal.

#### Polynesian Origins

The origins of Polynesian humans are still very much in doubt. Groups of
Polynesian mariners had existed 50,000 years ago, but they were not
colonizers. In fact, many scholars argue that eventual colonization
actually began as exploration. Around 2,500 years ago, we see more
permanent settlements in Fiji, Tonga, and other areas of the "remote"
Pacific, as remnants of pottery have been found there. Based on
linguistic and technological similarities among Polynesian cultures,
some scholars argue that Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga were a crucible of sorts
where Polynesians were "made" from groups from throughout Asia. Once
these cultural groups had a certain identity, they began to colonize
Easter Island, Hawaii, and New Zealand about and beyond 1,000 CE.

We cannot use land migration patterns to understand overseas migration.
The Pacific was somewhat of a highway, where currents and winds were
well-known and frequently used by mariners. Migrating humans were much
more likely to wander aimlessly on land than they were to let currents
take them to unknown parts of the ocean. Pacific mariners tended to use
the winds in their favor, and despite population pressures, Pacific
mariners were too adept at seafaring to suggest a simple casting out of
people into the Pacific in hopes of finding something. Once Pacific
colonization did commence, settlers were very deliberate about it,
taking with them families, plants, and animals. It seems that they had
every intention of recreating "home." In sum, the exploration was
neither extremely heroic nor extremely risky but instead was calculated
and not left to chance.

### 1.5.3 Hunter-Gatherers

Chapter Two explores the importance of farming to the creation and
expansion of early civilizations. However, farming was only invented
13,000 years ago, meaning that for most of human history, our food has
come through foraging. Early hominids like australopithecines, *Homo
habilis*, and *Homo erectus* ate mostly plant food. *Homo sapiens*
became more sophisticated foragers as they began to fish with hooks and,
more recently, nets and as they used stone grinding tools to produce
flour.

As food-gathering techniques evolved for these Paleolithic foragers, so
did their behavior as organized groups. Modern humans became mobile to
prevent resource depletion; they controlled population through
dispersion or infanticide, and they began to "live and work
cooperatively." Modern foragers also began to divide tasks and share
food with others, a feature that distinguishes them from other animals
like chimpanzees that live in communities but feed individually. Sharing
food is, of course, much easier to do when there is a surplus, and with
increasing tool use, Paleolithic humans became even more adept at
foraging, leading to the higher likelihood of food surpluses.

Tool use not only helped humans live cooperatively, but it also may have
helped hominids develop abstract thought---evidence of tool use may give
us a clue as to when this development began. We know that other animals
use tools, but even as long as 2.6 million years ago, we see evidence of
the creative thinking required to make more effective tools. ***Homo
habilis*** in fact takes its name ("handy man") from the fact that they
were the first known hominid tool-makers. Soon after individual tools
appeared, the **Oldowan Industry** became the first widely used toolset,
"consisting of flaked and smashed quartz riverside pebbles made into
poorly formed choppers and sharp stone flakes, \[and\] lasted for 1
million years with little change \[from 2.6 to 1.5 million years
ago\]."[^\[10\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-10 "Ristvet, 17-22."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-10
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 10"} The Oldowan were followed about 1.5
million years ago by hand axes that remained unchanged for more than a
million years. Many scholars argue that these smaller-brained hominids
like *Homo habilis, Homo ergaster, and Australopithecus* were both
unable and unwilling to innovate much beyond their simple but effective
tools, especially considering how harsh their environment could become.

Fire was another important tool, first used by *Homo erectus* about 1.6
million years ago. Fire would become important to migrants to colder
climes in Europe and Asia and to foragers who could now eat foods that
were poisonous if ingested raw. *Homo erectus* also cooked foods they
had previously eaten raw, thereby expanding their lifespan by
eliminating toxins found in raw meats.

*Homo sapiens* would add more meat to their diet when advances in
tool-making led to an increase in big game hunting during the late
Pleistocene. For example, excavations near **Dolni Vetoniçe** in the
Czech Republic have helped reveal a society that "used mammoth remains
not only for meat, but for fuel, construction, jewelry, and portable
art." The inhabitants of Dolni Vetoniçe also made thousands of ceramic
figurines, bird bone flutes, and ivory carvings of human heads. The cave
paintings of Lascaux also reflect this increased skill as both hunters
and painters. The colors and types of paint they used were vibrant and
durable, and the scenes they depicted demonstrated their use of diverse
hunting techniques. There we see depictions of humans hunting not only
deer but also woolly rhinoceros and mammoths.

Also at Lascaux, we see evidence that hunter-gatherers had both
religious beliefs and gender-specific tasks, reflecting a sophistication
that we usually only attribute to sedentary humans. The fact that humans
and animals were depicted together so often at Lascaux may be evidence
of a belief that man descended from these animals. Or perhaps the bison,
rhinoceros, and birds were painted on the walls to produce "hunting
magic" designed to make expeditions more successful. Finally, it was
mostly men depicted in these higher-risk hunting activities, suggesting
that women were the artists, participated less in the hunt, or both.

Closer to the Neolithic era, societies began to experience a growing
role for women reflected through their representation in "Venus"
statuettes. (See Figure 1.5.) As we get closer to the Neolithic era, we
see the relative role of women increasing; their place in ritual
increases, their stature increases, their economic importance increases,
and their childbearing uniqueness becomes more greatly emphasized.

Increased sophistication was not limited to big game hunters, however.
Campsites, rock art, and burial sites near Lake Mungo in Australia
reveal how these early humans used pottery for cooking and had a diverse
diet of birds, fish, and shellfish, a diet that seems to have kept them
well-nourished.[^\[11\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-11 "Ibid., 27-30."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-11
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 11"} Australia was a society of
hunter-gatherers until European colonization. Mobility was essential,
with the continent's lack of widespread rainfall and rich soil. As a
result, aboriginal Australians needed extensive knowledge of their
terrain and where to move when. Tasmanians would ambush wallabies at
their seasonal grazing territory, while aborigines in the central
deserts had to know when water holes would go dry. We also learn from
the remains of Australian aborigines that foragers could be quite
complex if they continued to hunt and gather for thousands of years.
Aborigines painted, developed advanced weapons like the boomerang,
warred against one another, developed creation myths, passed down oral
histories, and played musical instruments.

## 1.6 AGRICULTURE AND THE "NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION"

Historian Lauren Ristvet defines agriculture as the "'domestication' of
plants... causing it to change genetically from its wild ancestor in
ways \[that make\] it more useful to human
consumers."[^\[12\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-12 "Ibid., 36."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-12
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 12"} She and hundreds of other scholars
from Hobbes to Marx have pointed to the **Neolithic Revolution**---that
is, the move from a hunter-gatherer world to an agricultural one---as
the root of what we today refer to as civilization. Without agriculture,
we do not have empires, written language, factories, universities, or
railroads. Despite its importance, much remains unclear about why and
where agriculture began. Instead, scholars hold a handful of
well-regarded theories about the roots (pun intended) of agriculture.

Most scholars agree that the Ice Age played a fundamental role in the
rise of agriculture, in the sense that it was impossible during the much
colder and often tundra-covered period of the Pleistocene but inevitable
during the Holocene thawing. Only 4,000 years before the origins of
agriculture, the planting of anything would have been an exercise in
futility. During the Last Glacial Maximum (24,000--16,000 years ago),
average temperatures dropped "by as much as 57˚ F near the great ice
sheets..."[^\[13\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-13 "Ibid., 36-37."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-13
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 13"} This glaciation meant not only that
today's fertile farmlands of Spain or the North American Great Plains
were increasingly covered in ice but also that other areas around the
world could not depend on constant temperatures or rainfall from year to
year. Pleistocene foragers had to be flexible. The warming trend of the
Holocene, by contrast, resulted in consistent rainfall amounts and more
predictable temperatures. The warming also altered the habitats of the
megafauna that humans hunted, alterations that in some cases contributed
to their extinction. Therefore, as animal populations declined, humans
were further encouraged to plant and cultivate seeds in newly-thawed
soil.

When we start to examine other factors that allowed humans to transition
to agriculture, we find that the climate factor looms even larger. For
example, agriculture was usually accompanied by sedentarism, but we see
communal living and permanent settlements among multiple groups of
hunter-gatherers. *Homo sapiens* had also begun to domesticate animals
and plants alike during the Pleistocene. Humans were already being
buried alongside dogs as early as 14,000 years
ago.[^\[14\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-14 "Chris Scarre, ed. The Human Past: World Prehistory and the Development of Human Societies. 2nd ed. (London: Thames & Hudson, 2009), 183-84."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-14
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 14"} As we'll see below, gatherers were
developing an increasing taste for grains long before they would abandon
a foraging lifestyle. Essentially, humans were ready for agriculture
when climate permitted it.

We discuss elsewhere the timing of agriculture's appearance in all of
the continents, but generally speaking, by about 8,000 years ago,
farmers in West Asia were growing rye, barley, and wheat. In northern
China, millet was common 8,500 years ago. In the Americas, the
domestication of maize began around 8,000 years ago in Mesoamerica,
while at about the same time, Andean residents began cultivating
potatoes. Once all of these areas realized agriculture's potential as a
permanent food source, they began to adapt their societies to increase
their crop consistency and crop yields. We'll discuss how agriculture
affected societal development below.

### 1.6.1 First Farmers of West Asia (or the Fertile Crescent)

In later chapters, we will discuss Mesopotamia, the area between the
Euphrates and Tigris Rivers that agriculture would make the "cradle of
civilization." (See Map 2.1.) However, the incubator of Mesopotamian and
Fertile Crescent agriculture and cultural patterns dated back to the
foragers of the nearby Eastern Mediterranean, thousands of years before.
The rye, barley, and wheat in West Asia were first harvested by late
Pleistocene foragers called the Kebarans who ground wild wheat and
barley into a
porridge.[^\[15\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-15 "Ristvet, 41."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-15
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 15"} Kebarans consumed the porridge as
part of their broad-spectrum diet that also included land mammals,
birds, and fish. Advancing into the Holocene, we see the "**Natufian
Adaptation**," where residents of this same area began to see the
benefits of sedentary living as a precursor to the advent of
agriculture. The Natufians consumed the same rye, barley, and wheat that
their Kebaran predecessors had, but because their teeth were well-worn,
it appears they ate relatively more of it. Having a constant source of
these grains enabled their eschewing of long hunting or gathering
sojourns; instead, the Natufians drew more of their meat from in and
around Lake Huleh in modern Israel. Near Lake Huleh was Ain Mallaha, one
of the earliest examples of year-round human settlement and an important
precursor to sedentary agriculture.

::: chapter-1:-prehistory
Another permanent settlement in Southwest Asia seems to have been more
directly responsible for the decision to actually domesticate grain
rather than simply cultivate wild varieties. Abu Hureya in Syria was
deeply affected by the Younger Dryas event of 11,000 years ago, an event
that caused many of their wild food staples to disappear. Rather than
migrating out of the area, the Abu Hureyrans cultivated rye. Soon
afterward, other sites in the Levant began to see the planting of
barley, while wheat was cultivated in both the Levant and
Anatolia.[^\[16\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-16 "Ristvet, 41-42."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-16
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 16"}

### 1.6.2 First Permanent Settlements in West Asia (or the Fertile Crescent)

The transition from foraging to collecting to cultivating took place
over several centuries, but these gradual changes did serve to mark a
very distinct era of permanent settlement during the Neolithic period.
Increased rainfall around 9600 BCE meant that the Jordan River would
swell yearly, in the process depositing layers of fertile soil along its
banks. This fertile soil allowed locals to rely on agriculture for
survival. Soon after, **Jericho** was founded north of the Dead Sea;
"perhaps the very first time in human history that a completely viable
population was living in the same place at the same
time."[^\[17\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-17 "Steven Mithen, After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000–5,000 BC. (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003), 59."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-17
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 17"} By Jericho's height, around 9,000
BCE, the settlement's population reached the hundreds. This increase
cannot be considered an urban boom, of course, and the transition away
from foraging occurred gradually. For example, excavations from this
area have unearthed no separation of tasks or dwellings by gender or
skill. However, by the end of Jericho's development, maintaining large
populations in one place would prove to produce other extensive
adjustments.[^\[18\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-18 "Robert Strayer, Ways of the World: A Brief Global History with Sources, 2nd ed (New York, Bedford St. Martins, 2013), 40"){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-18

Jericho's residents did distinguish themselves from their
hunter-gatherer predecessors, however, through their relatively
extensive construction projects. They used mud bricks to build a wall
that encircled the settlement, probably for flood control; a tower; and
separate buildings for grain storage.

The former foragers now living at Jericho could rely on fish or other
aquatic creatures for meat as they experimented with permanent
settlement, but those foragers living further away from large bodies of
water would need another source of meat. This need increasingly was met
by animal domestication. Domestication would prove to be a slow process,
as humans learned the hard way that zebras bite, impalas are
claustrophobic, and bighorn sheep do not obey orders. In other words,
some animals cannot be domesticated, but this is information only
understood through trial and error. By about 7,500 BCE, however, humans
in the Taurus and Zagros mountains employed selective breeding to
eventually domesticate mountain sheep and goats. The temperament and
size of pigs and cows delayed their domestication until the 6,000s BCE,
but this process proved equally, if not more, important than that of
sheep and goats.

As agriculture and animal domestication progressed, settlements around
the Mediterranean became larger and more sophisticated. By 7,000 BCE on
the Anatolian plateau, Çatalhüyük reached several thousands of
inhabitants. The residents at Çatalhüyük buried their dead, constructed
uniform adjacent houses with elaborate designs painted on their interior
walls, and had multiple workshops where (among other activities) they
wove baskets and made obsidian mirrors as well as daggers with "carved
bone
handles."[^\[19\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-19 "Mithen, 94."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-19
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 19"} Çatalhüyük denizens wove wool into
cloth; developed a varied diet of peas, nuts, vegetable oil, apples,
honey, and the usual grains; and improved weapons technology with
sharper arrows added to their use of daggers and lances. These gains may
seem modest by our standards, but the legacy of communal living and,
ultimately, political centralization that they introduced was
extraordinary.

Jericho and Çatalhüyük were surely some of the most notable early
settlements, but they were not alone. The appearance of these two
settlements was accompanied by the increasing presence of village life
across the world. Most early agricultural villages in Southwest Asia and
around the world were very similar in appearance; they had around twenty
residents and were organized around grain cultivation and storage. Small
huts were organized in a "loose circle," and grain silos were placed
between each hut. Labor was a communal activity, and village members all
spent time hoeing the fields or hunting. The most valuable asset to a
community was the grain itself, but neither it nor the land where it
grew it belonged to one individual.

This model existed for hundreds and even thousands of years in some
areas, until the villages stopped hunting and domesticated animals. For
many scholars, the abandonment of hunting represents the "real"
Neolithic Revolution. As communities completely abandoned hunting and
gathering, they dedicated more energy to warfare, religion, and
construction; in consequence, dwellings and settlements grew, along with
a concomitant focus on tool and weapon
making.[^\[20\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-20 "Ristvet, 66."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-20

### 1.6.3 Leaving Paleolithic Culture Behind

While the Neolithic era is described in greater detail elsewhere, it is
important to understand Paleolithic and Neolithic differences in order
to convey a sense of just how revolutionary the shift to agriculture was
for humanity. For example, agriculture contributed to (along with
religion and trade) the development of class. Before agriculture,
hunter-gatherers divided tasks like seed gathering, grinding, or
tool-making. However, without large-scale building projects like
aqueducts or canals required for agriculture, hierarchies were much less
pronounced. The intensification of agriculture during the Neolithic era
required irrigation, plowing, and terracing, all of which were labor
intensive. The amount of labor required could not be met through simple
task division; someone had to be in charge. This meant the establishment
of ruling elites, a societal grouping that had not existed during the
Paleolithic era.

While violence certainly existed during the Paleolithic period,
organized warfare was an invention of the Neolithic. Agriculture meant
larger populations and settlements that were more tightly packed and
closer to one another. These closer quarters created new social and
economic pressures that could produce organized violence. Agricultural
intensification produced stores of food and valuables that could be
seized by neighbors. During the 9,000s BCE, settlements like Jericho
began to build defensive walls, while skeletons unearthed in the area
reveal wounds from new types of projectiles (like the Khiam Point)
developed during the
era.[^\[21\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-21 "Scarre, 192, 215."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-21
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 21"}

Family life also changed significantly during the Neolithic era.
Sedentary communities invested more time and resources into the
construction of permanent homes housing nuclear families. People spent
less time with the community as a whole, and within homes, it became
easier to accumulate wealth and keep secrets.

The shift in gender roles after agriculture seems to be even more
pronounced, as the role of women became more important as humans moved
out of the Paleolithic and into the Neolithic era.

During the Paleolithic era, and until recently in fact, a child would be
breastfed until he or she was three or four years old, a necessity
preventing mothers from joining long-distance hunting expeditions
without their toddlers. However, a breastfeeding woman could complete
tasks that "don't require rapt concentration, are relatively dull and
repetitive; they are easily interrupted, don't place the child in
danger, and don't require the participant to stray far from
home."[^\[22\]^](#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_footnote-141-22 "Elizabeth Wayland Barber, Women’s Work: The First 20,000 Years–Women, Cloth and Society in Early Times, (New York: Norton, 1995), 30."){#chapter-001-chapter-1-prehistory.xhtml_return-footnote-141-22
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 22"} Spinning, weaving, and sewing were
some of these tasks. Also, the essential tasks of preparing food and
clothing could be accomplished with a nursing toddler nearby. These
tasks that may be considered "women's work" today are among the most
important tasks (and very time-consuming ones before the industrial
revolution) that a human could perform. In fact, they were so
time-consuming that women would spend most of their day on them, often
being assisted by men.

Over time, Paleolithic women gathered new species of berries as well as
bird eggs and learned which mushrooms were nontoxic. Women also were the
principal gatherers of mosses for sleeping mats and other plants for
shelter. When men returned with a kill, the women then began an involved
process of dressing and butchering it. Sinews from animals and fibers
from plants became rope to tie or fasten the hides as well as baskets.
Women thus were essential to any kind of productivity or progress
associated with hunting. Women used sinews and fibers to create netting
for transport and for hunting and fishing. In hunting societies with
elements of horticulture, women were responsible for, and could provide,
such food as legumes, eggs, and grains. Food gathering and weaving,
especially in the dry Mediterranean, were outdoor and community
activities that also served as a preschool and apprentice system for
children. So women were also community educators.

#### Neolithic Women

While Paleolithic women certainly had important responsibilities, the
added tasks of herding and animal domestication expanded their roles
tremendously in the Neolithic era. Neolithic survival required not only
effective food storage but also increased production. Children on a farm
can be more helpful and put in less danger than those on a hunt.
Neolithic women increasingly bore more children, either because of
increased food production or to help augment it. This increase in
childbearing may also have offset an increase in mortality due, for
example, to disease. Because dangers from disease grew in new villages
due to the ease with which deadly diseases spread in close quarters, and
nearby domesticated animals whose diseases spread from animal to humans,
more children would be necessary to replace those who had succumbed to
illness.

While Neolithic women carried an increased childbearing responsibility,
their other responsibilities did not necessarily wane. Though women may
not have fired pottery when it began to appear, they appeared on it in
decorative symbols of female fertility. Around 4,000 BCE, gendered tasks
shifted again with the domestication of draft animals. Food production
once again became men's domain, as herding was incompatible with
childrearing. Later, in Neolithic herding societies, women were often
responsible for the actual domestication of feral babies, nursing them
and raising them. Men would shear sheep, help weave, market the
textiles, and cultivate the food that was prepared in the home.

We should say that this was not the case with all agricultural
societies, as many horticulturalists who were able to cultivate crops
closer to home were able to remain matrilineal. For example, we have the
case of Minoan women on the Mediterranean island of Crete that we
discuss in more detail in Chapter Five. On Crete's hilly terrain, women
were able to cultivate terraced horticulture and keep herds of sheep and
goats nearby. Therefore, as women lost power and influence elsewhere due
to more intensive agriculture, Minoan women actually expanded their
control over Crete's economic and cultural life and would help give rise
to Classical Greece.

### 1.6.4 Toward First Civilizations

We will discuss the Bronze Age elsewhere, but we should mention here
that new pursuits like mining added to the domestic burden on women. The
advent of the Bronze Age led to far-spread searching and mining for
copper and other metals like arsenic or tin to harden it and create the
bronze alloy. Mining consequently became a male pursuit. Between 9,000
and 4,000 BCE, as metal became a source for wealth and subsistence,
men's roles shifted from being secondary to being both the food
collectors and the economic backbone of individual families and
societies.

These Neolithic developments in sedentary agriculture and village life
would be the foundation for an explosion of cultural development three
thousand years later in Egypt and Mesopotamia (addressed later in this
text). By the Age of Exploration in the 1500s CE, most of the world had
adopted agriculture as a primary means of subsistence and the foundation
of great civilizations.

## 1.7 SUMMARY

The story of world civilizations really begins six to eight million
years ago when the ancestors of modern humans began to walk upright.
Millions of years of evolutionary response to changing climates and
environments led to the existence of our species, *Homo sapiens*. While
other hominids migrated out of Africa, had language, and made fire and
tools, it was *Homo sapiens* who were able to navigate open oceans and
eventually populate the entire planet. Over the last 50,000 years or so,
*Homo sapiens* became modern humans by improving their hunting, their
building techniques, their community living, and their food gathering
and storage. About 10,000 years ago, the Neolithic era began. Humans
began to live in larger, permanent settlements where a permanent food
source needed to be nearby. These were the beginnings of agriculture.
This "agricultural revolution" deeply affected gender relationships,
class distinctions, and economic priorities as most humans left their
foraging days behind them, the importance of which will be discussed in
later chapters.

## 2.2 INTRODUCTION: DEFINING CIVILIZATION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The term **civilization** often elicits mostly idealized images of
ancient empires, monumental architecture, and the luxurious lives of
ruling classes. Civilization, however, is a tricky term. In the United
States, students of history studied Western civilization, almost
exclusively, through the 1950s. In their studies, civilizations were
advanced societies with urban centers, rooted in European or Middle
Eastern culture. America's origins in these Western civilizations were
used to explain our own high level of development. However, more recent
scholars have definitely broadened the geographical focus by recognizing
that worldwide, from 3500 to 1000 BCE, at least seven independent
civilizations emerged in different regions. These recent scholars also
continue to debate the definition of civilization, and the current
compromise among World Historians is to recognize characteristics that
civilizations tended to share. Common characteristics of civilizations
included food surpluses, higher population densities, social
stratification, systems of taxation, labor specialization, regular
trade, and accumulated learning (or knowledge passed down from
generation to generation). The list here is not all-inclusive by any
means, but it indicates the complexity of the societies that scholars
have labeled civilizations.

In addition to heated debates about its exact definition, civilization
is a loaded term, meaning that it can contain a value judgment. If we
use the term carelessly, it seems to indicate that some societies are
deemed civilized and worthy of inclusion, while others are uncivilized
and thus not worth our study. In part, our sensitivity to this issue is
a response to the tendency of past historians, including many of those
working in Europe in the 1800s, to assume that there was a natural
progression from an uncivilized state to civilization. These historians
viewed people who had values, ways of living, and religious beliefs
different than theirs as uncivilized. They further believed that these
allegedly uncivilized peoples were behind or needed to catch up with
those who were civilized. Today, World Historians try to appreciate the
great diversity of human experiences and consciously remove these sorts
of value judgments. World Historians avoid assumptions that some
societies in the past were better or further along than others.
Therefore, many World Historians remain wary of the uncritical use of
the term civilization.

For our purposes, let us leave aside any value judgments. Societies
labeled as civilizations were not inherently better than any others. In
fact, as we will see, civilizations demonstrated various
vulnerabilities. Considering things like war, slavery, and the spread of
diseases, there were sometimes advantages to living outside the nexus of
civilizations. For example, in comparing societies, scholars have found
that in many instances people residing in decentralized states were
healthier and lived longer than did their counterparts in early
civilizations. However, people living in societies with social
stratification, labor specialization, and trade usually left more
written records and archeological evidence, which historians can analyze
to narrate our past. The available resources mean that civilizations
tend to be better represented in the written historical records. As you
read about past civilizations, keep in mind that historians are
currently enhancing our understanding of societies that perhaps remained
mobile, rejected hierarchies, or preserved their histories orally. These
societies were also part of our shared past, even if they are harder to
study or have received less scholarly attention.

This chapter focuses on early civilizations in the Fertile Crescent and
Northeast Africa. The civilizations in these regions left written
records. They also all initially had economies based on farming and
developed alongside rivers. Their locations alongside rivers allowed
populations in the Fertile Crescent and Northeast Africa to grow the
surplus food that they used to support urbanization, social
stratification, labor specialization, and trade.

## 2.5 ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Mesopotamia is located in an area known as the Fertile Crescent.
Archeologists have found some of the earliest known sites of
agricultural production in the Fertile Crescent. Although much of this
region received little or irregular rainfall, the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers provided large amounts of freshwater, facilitating agricultural
production and the development of early civilizations. The Greeks later
recognized the significance of the river systems to these ancient
societies and referred to the region as "the Land between the Rivers" or
**Mesopotamia**.

The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers both originate in the Taurus Mountains
of eastern Anatolia and flow southward to empty into the Persian Gulf.
The rivers carry and deposit silt downstream, enriching the soil. In
general, the richer soils and availability of water in areas that in the
north otherwise had little rain, or else towards the south had
concentrated months of rainfall followed by long dry spells, encouraged
settlement near the rivers. The areas closer to the Persian Gulf, known
as Lower Mesopotamia, in particular, were attractive to early settlers
because they had extremely fertile soils. People built some of the
earliest cities, including Uruk, Eridu, and Ur, in Lower Mesopotamia.

While the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers provided water to the region,
their floods were unpredictable and could even be catastrophic when they
washed away entire settlements. In response, the region's residents
created irrigation canals and drainage ditches to control the flow of
water. They also stored water in reservoirs to use during the dry months
of the year. Additionally, in parts of Lower Mesopotamia, the courses of
the rivers and their tributaries changed frequently, so people had to
either move to follow the water's new path or divert a river to continue
supplying water for their settlement. As regular access to water
supported agricultural surpluses and population growth, people tended to
fare better against the unpredictability of the floods, seasonal
changes, and the rivers' changing courses when they lived in settlements
capable of maintaining irrigation canals, drainage ditches, and water
reservoirs.

The rivers offered another benefit to ancient Mesopotamians. Just as the
rivers were definitely important to meet people's everyday needs for
water and for agricultural production, they also facilitated trade.
While people made use of local resources, like mud to build their homes,
in general, Lower Mesopotamia lacked other desired resources, including
wood, stone, and precious metals. Traders were able to use the rivers to
bring in these resources from Assyria, Anatolia, the Levant, and areas
adjacent to the Persian Gulf. Early Mesopotamians also obtained goods
from as far away as what today are northern Pakistan and India.
Merchants used overland routes that crossed the Iranian Plateau and sea
routes, exchanging Mesopotamian products like grains and textiles for
luxury goods from the east. Royal cemeteries show that by 2500 BCE
Mesopotamian elites were buried with a variety of imports, including
beads brought from the Indus River Valley. The rivers and the overland
trade routes also facilitated communication and, with it, the sharing of
ideas and technologies.

## 2.6 SUMERIAN CITY-STATES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Lower Mesopotamia, or the southern areas of Mesopotamia towards the
Persian Gulf, drew settlers, who moved to take advantage of rich soils
and the availability of water in the area commonly known as Sumer. The
people who lived in Sumer are generally referred to as Sumerians. Prior
to 3,000 BCE, Sumerians, whose origins remain a subject of debate,
founded a number of independent cities in Lower Mesopotamia. In these
cities, Sumerians had organized religions, centralized governments,
social hierarchies, and access to trade networks. As these cities
expanded, their leaders claimed control over adjacent territories,
forming at least a dozen **city-states**, which became the basic
organizational structure of Sumerian civilization in the third
millennium BCE. By incorporating the surrounding territories into
city-states, urban centers were able to draw on more resources.

Sumerian cities had certain characteristics in common. First, a temple
complex or a ziggurat was usually the visual focus of the urban
landscape. Sumerians believed that their entire city belonged to its
main deity and built a massive temple, the most important building in
the city, to be the dwelling place of their city's main god or goddess.
A complex that comfortably housed many of the priests and priestesses
who served the city's deity surrounded each temple. In addition to
attending to the religious needs of the community, temple complexes also
owned land, managed industries, were involved in trade, and acted as
banks. Their wide-ranging roles meant that temples often had additional
outbuildings, like granaries and storage sheds, in the surrounding
countryside. Sumerians were **polytheistic**, meaning they worshipped
multiple gods and goddesses. Because Sumerians believed each god had a
family, they also built smaller shrines and temples dedicated to these
divine family members. Therefore, each city would have a number of
temples, while many Sumerian homes had small altars dedicated to other
gods. Sometimes, urban temples or ritual spaces were built atop a
**ziggurat,** a solid rectangular tower made of sun-dried mud bricks.
Archaeological evidence shows that temple complexes were expanded and
rebuilt over time, and by the late third millennium BCE, temples in many
of the Sumerian city-states were raised on platforms or else situated on
a ziggurat. The towering architecture of the ziggurat stressed the
significance of the temple to the surrounding community. The
best-preserved ziggurat, the Great Ziggurat of Ur, was constructed with
an estimated 720,000 baked bricks and rose to a height of about 100
feet. The people of Ur constructed this ziggurat for their patron deity,
the moon goddess Nanna. They likely brought regular offerings to Nanna
and also received food rations from the Great Ziggurat of Ur.

several times since, including fairly recently in the 1980s. Author:

</figure>

Viewing nature as unpredictable, people brought offerings to their
city's temple complexes or ziggurat, hoping to please the gods who
controlled the natural forces of their world. Priests and priestesses
collected and redistributed the offerings, demonstrating the vital roles
they played in Sumerian society. The relatively privileged position of
priests and priestesses at the temple complex also shows Sumerian social
stratification (the development of a hierarchy) and how agricultural
surpluses supported the specialization of labor. Some of the early
leaders of Sumerian cities may have been "priest-kings," who attained
elevated positions through their association with the temples. The later
rulers of city-states definitely supported the temples, claiming to be
acting on behalf of the gods who brought divine favor to their
followers.

Sumerian city-states had local rulers, who lived in large palaces, but
most of these local rulers were not considered kings. So far,
archeologists have dated the earliest known royal palaces to c. 2600 BCE
and conclude that Sumerian city-states had centralized governments with
secular rulers by at least that timeframe. While there does seem to have
been a sense of inhabiting a shared space in Southern Mesopotamia,
referred to as "the Land" in written records, city-states had
distinctive identities. In part, their distinctive identities revolved
around their main deity. The rulers of city-states alternately
supported, competed with, and fought against one another. The Sumerian
King List (Figure 2.2), a manuscript that listed early kings and
described their reigns (with some presumably fictive and exaggerated
elements), provides evidence of these alliances, competition, and war.
For example, it describes En-mebarages as the second to last king of the
1^st^ Dynasty of Kish, "...who carried away as spoil the weapons of the
land of Elam, became king, and reigned 900
years...."[^\[1\]^](#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_footnote-243-1 "J. N. Postgate, Early Mesopotamia: Society and Economy at the Dawn of History, (London: Routledge, 1994): 28"){#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_return-footnote-243-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"}. Local rulers often came to power
after proving themselves militarily.

</figure>

Furthermore, the Sumerian King List recognized only rulers who had
established control over multiple city-states as kings (with the title
of *lugal* in the Sumerian language) belonging to distinct dynasties.
While it lasted, a dynasty generally passed down the kingship through
the male line. According to the Sumerian King List, the seat of power,
held by hereditary kings, shifted from city-state to city-state with the
rise and fall of dynasties through the third millennium BCE.
Significantly, the Sumerian King List began its recorded history "when
kingship came down from heaven," legitimizing secular kings through
their association with
gods[^\[2\]^](#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_footnote-243-2 "Ibid."){#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_return-footnote-243-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"}. There was at least one woman who
ruled in her own right: Ku-Baba was listed in the Sumerian King List.
Sumerian kings, often along with more local rulers, led armies,
collected taxes, organized labor for state projects, and meted out
justice. At the top of the hierarchy and with control over multiple
city-states, kings expected obedience from local rulers and their
subjects and support from the priests and priestesses of the temples.

Kings, local rulers, priests, and priestesses held influential positions
in Sumerian societies. However, farmers, taken as a whole, made up an
estimated 90% of the population. Other skilled people included
animal-breeders, merchants, craftspeople, fishermen, doctors, soldiers,
architects, and scribes. Surplus agricultural production collected as
tribute as well as wealth generated by trade supported such labor
specialization. One important outcome of labor specialization was
innovation in metalworking. In approximately 2900 BCE, metalworkers
began producing bronze, which was stronger than copper. Stronger weapons
and farming tools gave Sumerians advantages when it came to combat and
agricultural production.

Social stratification is further evident as some Sumerians and even
institutions, including temples, owned slaves. Slaves performed a
variety of tasks like construction, weaving, agricultural and domestic
labor, tending animals, and even administrative work as scribes. Some
slaves were chattel slaves, meaning that society treated them as
property with no rights. Usually, chattel slaves were prisoners of war
or slaves bought from outside communities. They were branded by barbers
or tattoo artists and forced to work at the will of their masters. If
they tried to run away, the law required slaves to be returned. The more
widespread type of servitude in most Sumerian societies was likely debt
slavery, which was generally temporary until a debtor paid off a loan
and its interest. Over the past century or so, archaeologists have added
a great deal to our understanding of Sumerian social distinctions
through their work at numerous excavation sites, but many gaps in our
knowledge still exist.

</figure>

The archaeological discovery of cuneiform tablets at these excavation
sites has aided efforts to learn about this civilization. Sumerians
developed **cuneiform**, a written script of wedge-shaped marks, around
3200 BCE. Cuneiform was one of the earliest, if not the very first,
written script in the world. The Sumerian King List, discussed above,
was recorded in cuneiform. Merchants, scribes, administrators, priests,
and others kept written records describing financial transactions, court
proceedings, administrative decisions, and architectural plans.

They also wrote legends, epic poems, chants, and prayers. Most people
were not literate, so scribes---who had been specially trained in
scribal schools---generated many of the records. While in school, in
addition to copying written passages, scribes learned arithmetic. The
Sumerian system of arithmetic was based on the number 60, which we still
use to divide time into hours, minutes, and seconds. Scribes used
styluses made of reed to write on clay tablets that were dried and could
be stored. The discovery of cuneiform tablets has greatly aided
archaeologists, but only a small percentage of the tablets found to date
have been translated.

Using archaeological and written evidence, scholars have pieced together
what they can about everyday life for Sumerians, though some questions
remain. For instance, it has been a challenge to determine the layout of
urban spaces beyond the prominence of the temples and the relative
grandeur of palaces. From archaeological finds, scholars suspect that
Sumerian cities were divided into neighborhoods by occupation and
according to kinship groups, but uncertainties about specifics linger.
Legal documents and tax records show that people owned property in both
the cities and the countryside. Also, evidence suggests social
stratification, as some Sumerians owned fairly large chunks of land,
while others had much smaller plots or presumably no land at all. Wills,
court proceedings, and temple documents show that land and temple
offices were usually bought or else acquired through military or other
service to the state. A man inherited land, property, offices, and their
attendant obligations to the state (like reoccurring military service)
from his father. The eldest son seems to have frequently inherited a
larger share than younger brothers and have been given control over the
family home. He was tasked with performing regular rituals to honor dead
ancestors, who were usually buried underneath the home. From the written
documents, we also get glimpses into other aspects of Sumerian life,
like marriage and divorce.

Sumerians viewed marriage as a contract between two families, and as a
result, the male heads of the two families arranged a couple's marriage.
Documents show that both families contributed resources to seal the
union or complete the marriage contract. The man's family gave gifts or
money and hosted a feast, while the woman's family amassed a dowry.
Although a woman did not automatically receive an inheritance upon the
death of her father, she could expect to receive (and use the court
system to make sure she got) a dowry, even if it came from her father's
estate after his death. Divorce was possible but sometimes led to social
ostracism or even punishment if there were accusations of misconduct,
such consequences being especially the case for the woman. Records
indicate that polygamy was not common, but wealthier men kept slave
girls as concubines. Overall, Sumerians considered marriage an essential
institution because it brought families together and ensured the
continuation of the family lineage.

Legends, myths, poems, and literary texts tell us about Sumerians, too.
For example, we can explore their values and views of the afterlife
through reading the *Epic of Gilgamesh*. The *Epic of Gilgamesh* relates
the adventures of Gilgamesh, a legendary king, who may have lived around
2700 BCE. The epic has multiple versions and was told orally before it
was first written down in cuneiform in about 2000 BCE. The epic follows
the heroic exploits of Gilgamesh and his companion, Enkidu, to emphasize
the importance of values such as loyalty and humility. In one section,
the epic describes a very gloomy afterlife where "people see no light,
they sit in darkness,"
[^\[3\]^](#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_footnote-243-3 "Excerpt from: The Epic of Gilgamesh, trans. Nancy Sandars (New York: Penguin Books, 1960), http://web.archive.org/web/20010217041824/http://www.humanities.ccny.cuny.edu/history/reader/gilgames.htm"){#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_return-footnote-243-3
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 3"} reflecting Mesopotamian beliefs that
the afterlife was miserable for all, even those who had lived
virtuously. Additionally, it portrays the environment as potentially
violent and hostile as in flood stories, which in some ways resembles
the account of Noah and the flood found in Genesis. Ultimately,
Gilgamesh fails at his quest to find eternal life but learns to work for
the glory of the gods and for worthwhile human achievements.

Other archaeological finds and written documents also give some hint of
the wider popular culture and artistic conventions in ancient
Mesopotamia. For example, cuneiform tablets with pictures of dancers and
singers, as well as instruments found in graves, suggest that Sumerians
placed importance on music, using it for entertainment and ritual
purposes. Trying to learn more about Sumerian music, scholars and other
enthusiasts have replicated these instruments and presented their best
estimation of Sumerian scales and tuning. The documentary evidence
suggests that hymns from the ancient Sumerian city-states were shared
with later Mesopotamian empires and even spread into the Mediterranean
world.

## 2.7 MESOPOTAMIAN EMPIRES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In the second half of the third millennium BCE, Sumerian city-states
fought each other, and dynasties rose and fell. Kings consolidated power
over multiple city-states in the region. Then, King Sargon of Akkad
enlarged the scale by conquering the Sumerian city-states and parts of
Syria, Anatolia, and Elam. In doing so, he created one of the world's
first empires in approximately 2334 BCE. For generations, Mesopotamian
literature celebrated the Akkadian Empire (c. 2334--2100 BCE) that King
Sargon founded. Like the Akkadian Empire, three subsequent empires, the
Babylonian Empire (c. 1792--1595 BCE), the Assyrian Empire (c. 900--612
BCE), and the Neo-Babylonian Empire (c. 626--539 BCE), also ruled large
parts of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent.

### 2.7.1 The Akkadian Empire (c. 2334--2100 BCE)

**Sargon of Akkad** founded the first empire in Mesopotamia. Legends
about Sargon of Akkad stress that he rose from obscurity to become a
famous, powerful king. While the legends all tend to describe him as
coming from humble origins and rising to the top using his own wits,
there are many variations. One much later Babylonian tablet, from the
seventh century BCE, describes his background as a descendent of a high
priestess and an anonymous father. His mother hid her pregnancy and the
birth of Sargon, secreting him away in a wicker basket on a river, where
he was rescued and then raised by Aqqi, a water-drawer. This version of
the legend links Sargon with a more elite family through his birth
mother, a high priestess, but also shows how he had to advance himself
up to king after being adopted by the rather more humble figure of a
water-drawer.

</figure>

From his allegedly humble origins, Sargon of Akkad conquered Sumerian
city-states one by one, creating an **empire,** or a large territory,
encompassing numerous states, ruled by a single authority. It's quite
possible that Sargon of Akkad's predecessor, who claimed to rule over
the large region stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian
Gulf, began the process of building the empire, but Sargon is remembered
for accomplishing the task. One of the reasons we attribute the empire
to him is his use of public monuments. He had statues, stelae (tall,
upright pillars), and other monuments built throughout his realm to
celebrate his military victories and to build a sense of unity within
his empire. Archaeologists have not found the empire's capital city,
Akkad. However, from the available information, archaeologists have
estimated its location, placing it to the north of the early
Mesopotamian city-states, including Ur and Sumer. It is clear that
Sargon of Akkad turned the empire's capital at Akkad into one of the
wealthiest and most powerful cities in the world. According to
documentary sources, the city's splendor stood as another symbol of
Sargon's greatness. The city grew into a cosmopolitan center especially
because of its role in trade. Akkadian rulers seized and taxed trade
goods, with trade routes extending as far as India. Sargon ruled the
empire for over fifty years. His sons, grandson, and great-grandson
attempted to hold the empire together. After about 200 years, attacks
from neighboring peoples caused the empire to fall. After the fall of
the Akkadian Empire, Hammurabi founded the next empire in the region in
1792 BCE.

### 2.7.2 The Babylonian Empire (1792--1595 BCE)

Hammurabi, who aspired to follow Sargon's example, created the next
empire in the region, the Babylonian Empire. With well-disciplined foot
soldiers armed with copper and bronze weapons, he conquered Mesopotamian
city-states, including Akkad and Sumer, to create an empire with its
capital at Babylon. Although he had other achievements, Hammurabi is
most famous for the law code etched into a stele that bears his name,
the Stele of Hammurabi.

</figure>

The Stele of Hammurabi records a comprehensive set of laws. Codes of law
existed prior to Hammurabi's famous stele, but **Hammurabi's Code** gets
a lot of attention because it is still intact and has proven very
influential. As seen in Figure 2.5, the upper part of the stele depicts
Hammurabi standing in front of the Babylonian god of justice, from whom
Hammurabi derives his power and legitimacy. The lower portion of the
stele contains the collection of 282 laws. One particularly influential
principle in the code is the law of retaliation, which demands "an eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." The code listed offenses and their
punishments, which often varied by social class. While symbolizing the
power of King Hammurabi and associating him with justice, the code of
law also attempted to unify people within the empire and establish
common standards for acceptable behavior. An excerpt of Hammurabi's Code
appears below:

> 6\. If anyone steal the property of a temple or of the court, he shall
> be put to death, and also the one who receives the stolen thing from
> him shall be put to death.
>
> 8\. If any one steal cattle or sheep, or an ass, or a pig or a goat,
> if it belong to a god or to the court, the thief shall pay thirtyfold
> therefore; if they belonged to a freed man of the king he shall pay
> tenfold; if the thief has nothing with which to pay he shall be put to
> death.
>
> 15\. If any one receive into his house a runaway male or female slave
> of the court, or of a freedman, and does not bring it out at the
> public proclamation of the major domus, the master of the house shall
> be put to death.
>
> 53\. If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and
> does not so keep it; if then the dam break and all the fields be
> flooded, then shall he in whose dam the break occurred be sold for
> money, and the money shall replace the corn which he has caused to be
> ruined.
>
> 108\. If a tavern-keeper (feminine) does not accept corn according to
> gross weight in payment of drink, but takes money, and the price of
> the drink is less than that of the corn, she shall be convicted and
> thrown into the water.
>
> 110\. If a "sister of god" open a tavern, or enter a tavern to drink,

Hammurabi also improved infrastructure, promoted trade, employed
effective administrative practices, and supported productive
agriculture. For example, he sponsored the building of roads and the
creation of a postal service. He also maintained irrigation canals and
facilitated trade all along the Persian Gulf. After Hammurabi's death,
his successors lost territory. The empire declined, shrinking in size.
The Hittites, from Anatolia, eventually sacked the city of Babylon in
1595 BCE, bringing about the official end of the Babylonian Empire.

### 2.7.3 The Assyrian Empire (c. 900--612 BCE)

The **Assyrian Empire**, which saw its height of power at the end of the
first millennium to the seventh century BCE, was larger than any empire
that preceded it.

Dominating the region, its well-equipped soldiers used their stronger
iron weapons to extend the empire's control through Mesopotamia, Syria,
parts of Anatolia, Palestine, and up the Nile into Egypt. They used
siege warfare, along with battering rams, tunnels, and moveable towers,
to get past the defenses of cities. The Assyrians had a large army (with
perhaps as many as 150,000 soldiers) that utilized a core of infantry, a
cavalry, as well as chariots. As part of their military strategy, the
Assyrians purposefully tried to inspire fear in their enemies; they
decapitated conquered kings, burnt cities to the ground, destroyed
crops, and dismembered defeated enemy soldiers. One Assyrian soldier
claimed:

> In strife and conflict I besieged \[and\] conquered the city. I felled
> 3,000 of their fighting men with the sword...I captured many troops
> alive: I cut off of some of their arms \[and\] hands; I cut off of
> others their noses, ears, \[and\] extremities. I gouged out the eyes
> of many troops. I made one pile of the living \[and\] one of heads. I
> hung their heads on trees around the city.
> [^\[5\]^](#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_footnote-243-5 "Quoted in Erika Belibtreau, “Grisly Assyrian Record of Torture and Death,” http://faculty.uml.edu/ethan_Spanier/Teaching/documents/CP6.0AssyrianTorture.pdf"){#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_return-footnote-243-5
> .footnote aria-label="Footnote 5"}.

The Assyrians expected these methods to deter potential rebellions and
used their spoils of war, like precious metals and livestock, to finance
further military campaigns. After conquering an area, they conscripted
men into their army and employed resettlement and deportation as
techniques to get laborers where they wanted them and deal with
communities who opposed their regime. They also collected annual
tributes that were apparently high enough to, at least occasionally,
spur rebellions despite the Assyrians' reputation for violent
retribution.

</figure>

In addition to its military strength, the Assyrian Empire also stands
out for the size of its cities and its administrative developments. The
empire's biggest cities, such as Nineveh and Assur, each had several
million people living within them. Administratively, kings ruled
Assyria, appointing governors to oversee provinces and delegates to keep
tabs on the leaders of allied states. There were between 100 and 150
governors, delegates, and top officials entrusted by the king with
ruling in his place and helping him maintain the empire. In the later
centuries of the Assyrian Empire, kings chose these officials on the
basis of merit and loyalty. Kings met with large groups of officials for
rituals, festivals, and military campaigns. Evidence of such meetings
has led some scholars to propose the possibility that the king and his
officials might have worked together in something resembling a
parliamentary system, though there is no scholarly consensus on the
point. Ultimately, the Assyrian Empire became too large to control;
rebellions occurred with more frequency and were difficult for its
overextended military to quell. The empire fell after the conquest of
Nineveh in 612 BCE.

### 2.7.4 The New Babylonian Empire (c. 626--539 BCE)

With the weakening of the Assyrian Empire, the New Babylonian Empire
began to dominate Mesopotamia. Lasting for less than 100 years, the New
Babylonian Empire is best known for its ruler, **Nebuchadnezzar II**,
and its great architectural projects. As described in the Hebrew
Scriptures (also known as the Old Testament), Nebuchadnezzar II, who
ruled from 605 to 562 BCE, was a ruthless leader. He gained notoriety
for destroying the city of Jerusalem and deporting many of the city's
Jews to Babylon. The captive Jews suffered in exile, as they were not
allowed to return to their homeland. Nebuchadnezzar II also rebuilt
Babylon with fortresses, temples, and enormous palaces. He associated
the New Babylonian Empire with the glory of ancient Babylonia by
reviving elements of Sumerian and Akkadian culture. For example, he had
artists restore ancient artwork and celebrated the kings of old, like
Hammurabi. Nebuchadnezzar is often also credited with rebuilding the
city's ziggurat, *Etemanaki*, or the "Temple of the Foundation of Heaven
and Earth." When completed, the ziggurat rose several stories above the
city and seemed to reach to the heavens. Some scholars claim that the
Babylonian ziggurat was the famous Tower of Babel described in the Old
Testament. Another one of Nebuchadnezzar's purported projects, the
Hanging Gardens of Babylon, was considered by the later Greek historian
Herodotus to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World. According to
legend, Nebuchadnezzar had the hanging gardens built for his wife. He
made the desert bloom to remind her of her distant homeland; the
elaborate gardens planted on rooftops and terraces were designed so that
the plants' leaves would spill down high walls. Since definitive
archaeological evidence of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon has not been
found, scholars continue to debate its most likely location and even its
very existence. After the death of Nebuchadnezzar II, outside military
pressures as well as internal conflict weakened the empire until the
much larger Persian Empire conquered the New Babylonian Empire in 539
BCE.

## 2.8 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MESOPOTAMIA FOR WORLD HISTORY

Mesopotamia saw the emergence of some of the first cities and the
world's first empires. The city-states of the region flourished from
about 3000 to 2300 BCE. Then, Sargon of Akkad and subsequent rulers
built empires, expanding their control and influence over even larger
territories. There were cultural links and commonalities found in the
Sumerian city-states of the third millennium BCE. With agricultural
production dependent on access to water, cities initially grew in
Southern Mesopotamia near rivers, namely the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers
and their tributaries. Sumerians tried to control their environment
using irrigation, drainage ditches, water reserves, and other methods.
With unpredictable floods and other environmental challenges, the
Sumerians viewed nature as hostile, and their expectations of the
afterlife tended to be pessimistic. Their understanding of nature as
unpredictable also spurred engineering innovations as Sumerians prepared
for floods, water shortages, and other natural events. While farming was
the mainstay of their economies, city-states were also involved in
robust long-distance trade networks, which allowed them to garner the
many resources not available in their region. These city-states
alternately allied with, competed against, and waged war on one another,
with kingship emerging as rulers dominated multiple city-states. As
evidenced by the centrality of temples and the belief that kingship came
from heaven, religion was of fundamental importance to these societies.
Archaeologists have also uncovered ample evidence of social
stratification and labor specialization in these ancient city-states.
Archeologists have been able to recognize Sumerian developments, in
part, because the Sumerians left behind a wealth of information
documented in cuneiform, one of the world's first written scripts.
Scholars have begun to describe life in ancient Sumerian societies and
appreciate the many Sumerian achievements, like those in math, where
they introduced a computation system based on 60 (which we still use to
divide time and in geometry, as a circle has 360°). Overall, Sumerians
were innovators, with some of the first cities, one of the first systems
of writing, notable achievements in engineering and architecture, the
creation of larger political entities, and more.

Starting with the Akkadian Empire, four empires controlled vast
territories in Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. Over a period of
almost 1800 years, these empires brought together diverse communities,
often by military conquest and force. The empires facilitated trade and
spread ideas and culture. Their rulers developed administrative,
military, and other techniques to try to ensure compliance and
recognition of their authority. As intended, the rulers and the cities
they built live on in legends, even though their empires eventually
withered and fell.

## 2.9 THE ISRAELITES AND ANCIENT ISRAEL

The Israelites, or "children of Israel," were Semitic speakers who lived
in Canaan and traced their descent back to Abraham through his grandson
Israel. Hebrew tradition begins their history with Abraham's departure
from Ur in Southern Mesopotamia (see Map 2.1). Therefore, Abraham is
important in Jewish tradition, as he has been recognized as the first
Jew, the patriarch from whom all Jews trace their descent, and a role
model. As described in the Hebrew Scriptures, known to Christians as the
Old Testament, Abraham also made a covenant with God, which blessed his
descendants. Jews, Christians, and Muslims of today all recognize
Abraham as a significant figure, though these major monotheistic
religions view him a little differently. Respect for Abraham by
believers in all three of these religions is just one indication that
the world's three major monotheistic religions are connected. Examining
these connections reveals the extraordinary contributions that the
Israelites made to world history. The Israelites were highly influential
in developing the idea of **monotheism**, or belief in one god.
Furthermore, they recorded their history orally at first, until their
tradition was written down in the Hebrew Scriptures (alternatively
referred to as the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible, or the Old Testament of the
Christian Bible). The Hebrew Scriptures has been one of the most
important texts ever written.

Eventually, by the end of the second millennium BCE (likely between 1200
and 1000 BCE), the Israelites established small kingdoms in the
**Levant**. The Levant refers to areas adjacent to the eastern
Mediterranean; in the ancient world, it comprised roughly the area from
southern Anatolia through coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean
south and westward to the Egyptian delta. The Israelite kingdoms were
concentrated along the Mediterranean coast in what are today Israel and
the contested territory of the West Bank/Palestine.

Much debate exists amongst scholars about the sources used to
reconstruct the history of the Israelites, with much of the debate
revolving around the use and interpretation of religious texts,
particularly the Hebrew Scriptures. Right now, scholars rely fairly
heavily on the Hebrew Scriptures to discuss periods before about 1200
BCE because other sources just do not exist. Some main points of
contention have centered on dates, the purpose of religious texts, the
reality that the Hebrew Scriptures were written centuries after the
events they described, and the relationship between the scriptures and
historical fact. Additionally, there has been back-and-forth discussion
about whether archaeological finds confirm or disprove the narrative in
the religious texts. These heated debates have led some scholars to
question whether it is even possible to write a history of the ancient
Israelites. For our purposes, this section will give an overview of
Hebrew tradition and, using archaeological and collaborating evidence
when possible, describe the development of the Israelite civilization.

## 2.10 EARLY ISRAELITES

By leading people out of Ur, his homeland in Southern Mesopotamia, to
eventually settle in Canaan, later called Palestine, Abraham began the
traditional history of the Israelites. According to Hebrew tradition,
even before leaving Ur, Abraham taught his followers about the existence
of a single creator god and rejected the idol-worship and sin of Ur. The
narrative continues to explain how when Abraham agreed to God's
directive to leave his homeland, God blessed him and all of his
descendants. God entered into a **covenant** with Abraham, saying,
"...And I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you, and I
will make your name great...and by you all the families of the earth
shall bless
themselves."[^\[6\]^](#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_footnote-243-6 "http://www.ijs.org.au/Abraham-and-the-Covenant/default.aspx"){#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_return-footnote-243-6
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 6"} Jews recognize this covenant as
indicating their special relationship with God, and it remains one of
the most important aspects of the Jewish faith.

Tradition recounts how several generations later, Abraham's grandson,
Israel (also called Jacob), had twelve sons, who became the ancestors of
the Twelve Tribes of Israel. One of these twelve sons, Joseph, led
followers from Canaan during a famine to settle in Egypt. As the
biblical text describes, the Israelites were prosperous at first and
were becoming powerful, leading the Egyptian pharaoh to fear their
influence. To try to stem the Israelite influence, the pharaoh put
restrictions on births and forced them into slave labor. Then, Moses,
whose mother had secreted him away in a waterproof basket on the Nile
River, played an important role in delivering his people from
subjugation. According to Hebrew tradition, God tasked Moses with
leading his people out of Egypt, a flight to freedom called **Exodus**.
Moses led "the children of Israel" into Sinai, where they entered into
the Sinai Covenant. This covenant bound all Israelites into a pact with
God. Israelites agreed to worship God alone and obey his law, while God
confirmed the place of the Israelites as his "Chosen People," whom he
would protect. As part of the covenant, Israelites agreed to follow the
**Ten Commandments**. According to Hebrew tradition, God gave the Ten
Commandments to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, instructing the
Israelites to worship only him, keep the Sabbath, and honor their
parents. The Ten Commandments also prohibit idolatry, blasphemy, murder,
adultery, theft, dishonesty, and coveting.

These written traditions established important elements of the Jewish
faith. For example, the Hebrew Scriptures trace Jewish descent from the
Hebrew patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Israel (alternatively known as
Jacob), and the twelve sons of Israel. They also describe the transition
to monotheism and the covenant relationship between God and "the
children of Israel." Israelites believed in one god, Yahweh, who created
and ruled over everything in the universe, and overall, they perceived
Yahweh as being just and merciful. The ideas that there is a single
universal god and that his laws apply to everyone have been defining
tenets of other monotheistic religions. Subsequent written and oral
traditions, like the Talmud, reflect further development of Jewish
beliefs, ethics, laws, and practice.

## 2.11 THE UNITED KINGDOM OF ISRAEL

After Exodus, the Israelites resettled in Canaan and in time began to
unify. They formed kingdoms in the Levant just prior to 1000 BCE. King
Saul (c. 1030--1009 BCE), a member of one of the Twelve Tribes of
Israel, established the first Israelite monarchy but ruled over a fairly
limited territory and died in battle with the Philistines. He was
crowned king and began the process of unification but did not completely
defeat his enemies and finish unification before he died. His successor,
King David (d. 969 BCE), is often portrayed as Israel's greatest ruler
or a model king. He established the United Kingdom of Israel, with its
capital at Jerusalem. King David's successor, his son Solomon, further
shaped the kingdom.

In popular memory, King David is probably most remembered for defeating
Goliath. Historical traditions also celebrate him for expanding the
borders of a newly unified Israel, contributing to the Book of Psalms,
and, in Christian tradition, being a forbear of Jesus. David was a
"warrior king," who defeated both internal and external enemies to unite
Israel. He maintained a large standing army that helped extend his
influence and create neighboring tributary states. With control of trade
routes and tribute coming in from neighboring territories, Israel became
a wealthy state under David. With this wealth, David began to build
Jerusalem into the capital city of the Israelites, with further plans to
build a temple to house the Ark of the Covenant (which, according to
Hebrew tradition, held the Ten Commandments). David died before building
this temple, but tradition credits him with other achievements,
including composing many of the hymns and prayers in the Book of Psalms.
Like Abraham, David is considered an important figure by Jews,
Christians, and Muslims.

King Solomon, David's son, ruled a mostly peaceful realm. He
accomplished his father's goal of building the first Jewish temple in
Jerusalem. The temple exemplified monumental architecture and became a
focal point for the Jews of Jerusalem. Its ruins, known as the Western
Wall or the Wailing Wall, are still a site of Jewish prayer and
pilgrimage. Solomon also directed the building of a royal palace, a
defensive wall around the city of Jerusalem, and fortresses along the
kingdom's frontier. Administratively, Solomon set up twelve districts,
overseen by purveyors, who collected tribute in kind (usually as crops
or foodstuffs). Each of the twelve districts was charged with supplying
the king and the court for one month a year. Finally, Solomon used
treaties and reciprocal trade agreements to maintain relatively peaceful
relationships with Israel's neighbors. He also forged diplomatic
relations through marriage; according to scripture, he had 700 wives!
After Solomon's death, what had been the United Kingdom of Israel split
into two pieces: Israel and Judah. Over the long term, some of Solomon's
policies, including forced labor and tributary payments, likely
contributed to the divide.

</figure>

After the decline of the United Kingdom of Israel, Hebrew tradition
describes the significance of great **prophets** or teachers, who spoke
on behalf of God and set moral and ethical standards for the whole
community. Yahweh sent these prophets to warn the Israelites that they
were not abiding by their covenant. The prophets during this later
period, especially Jeremiah and Second Isaiah, cultivated a new
conceptualization of the covenant, which was much more personal as it
was a relationship between Yahweh and each individual.

The Assyrians and later the Greeks and then the Romans brought parts of
the former United Kingdom of Israel under their rule. These conquests
and persecution forced members of the Jewish population into exile. This
conceptualization of being members of a **diaspora**---that is, a
scattered people who desire to return to their homeland---has played an
important part in the formation of a Jewish identity. Also, in part, due
to this history, preservation of cultural and religious heritage has
become an enduring objective of Jews.

## 2.12 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISRAELITES AND ANCIENT ISRAEL

The Israelites left an extraordinary religious and ethical legacy. They
were some of the first monotheists, worshipping a single god, whom they
referred to as Yahweh. Their religious texts from the ancient world,
including the Hebrew Scriptures, served as the foundational texts of
Judaism. The Hebrew Scriptures were also the basis of the Christian Old
Testament, and Islam recognizes parts of the scriptures as divine
revelations. There were other widespread religious influences as well.
For example, Christians and Muslims consider many of the figures,
including Abraham, Moses, and David, and teachings, like the Ten
Commandments, from the Hebrew Scriptures to be very important.
Furthermore, the Hebrew Scriptures contained the idea that everyone,
regardless of status, was bound to obey the law.

The United Kingdom of Israel was a "golden age," associated with the
creation of a unified, wealthy state with its new capital in Jerusalem.
This civilization had well-developed religious traditions, political
power vested in a king, monumental architecture, and administrative
innovations. It also maintained a strong military, multiple tributary
states, long-distance trade networks, and well-established diplomatic
relationships with foreign states.

## 2.13 ANCIENT EGYPT

In our study of world history, ancient Egypt serves as an excellent
example of a complex society with cross-cultural connections, adaption
to and control over changing environments, and sophisticated political
and religious developments. All of these themes are evident in an
examination of the origins of Egypt. Egyptian leaders unified Upper and
Lower Egypt around 3100 BCE, creating a powerful ancient state.
Developments in the millennia preceding unification, including the
sharing of innovations and responses to environmental change, set the
stage for the emergence of the Egyptian civilization.

Cross-cultural connections introduced the people of Northeast Africa to
domesticated wheat and barley, two of the crops that they grew and whose
surpluses supported the process of social differentiation and eventually
the pharaonic, elite, and skilled classes of ancient Egypt. People in
Northeast Africa had likely been gathering wild barley since before
10,000 BCE. However, sharing in the knowledge spreading from the Fertile
Crescent around 7,000 BCE, they began cultivating wheat and barley and
also keeping domesticated animals, including sheep and goats. At that
time, agricultural production and herding were possible in areas that
are today part of the Sahara Desert. The period was much wetter than
now. People in the region settled into small communities, and
archaeological evidence of hearths, grinding stones, and storage silos
shows the growth of settlements in areas that today are not well-watered
enough for agricultural production. The presence of crocodile bones,
along with similar pottery styles, also suggests a history of contact
between communities emerging along the Nile River and these settlements
farther west. However, environmental change was leading to the
**desiccation** or drying out of areas not adjacent to the Nile River,
and by about 5,000 BCE, it was no longer possible to farm much beyond
the floodplain of the Nile River. Many people adapted by moving towards
the Nile River, and the Nile River became increasingly important to
Egypt's populations.

The **Nile River** flows south to north, fed by two main river systems:
the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile flows steadily
throughout the year and has its origins in the Great Lakes region of
East Africa. The Blue Nile originates in the Ethiopian Highlands, and
brings floodwaters up past the first **cataract** in the summers. (The
first cataract lies roughly at Aswan in Map 2.6.) Cataracts are
generally considered impassable by boat due to their shallows, rocks,
and rapids. Comparatively, the floodplain of the Nile River is narrow,
leading, especially with the desiccation of the surrounding areas, to
high population densities close to the river. The winds also blow north
to south, in the opposite direction of the river flow, thus facilitating
trade and contact between Upper Egypt (to the south) and Lower Egypt (to
the north). Upper and Lower Egypt lie north of the first cataract,
usually allowing river traffic to proceed uninterrupted throughout the
territory. Egyptian views of the Nile generally recognized the river's
centrality to life as demonstrated in the "Hymn to the Nile," dated to
approximately 2100 BCE. The praise-filled ode to the Nile River begins,
"Hail to thee, O Nile! Who manifests thyself over this land, and comes
to give life to Egypt." "Hymn to the Nile, c. 2100 BCE." Ancient History
Sourcebook Fordham University.

.footnote aria-label="Footnote 7"} The course of the Nile River
definitely impacted settlement patterns, while the river also allowed
for trade and the development of larger agricultural communities.

At the tail end of that era of desiccation, from about 3600 to 3300 BCE,
complex societies formed in areas adjacent to the Nile River. These
communities exerted increased influence over their environments,
exhibited social differentiation, and showed evidence of labor
specialization. For example, people in the settlements of Naganda and
Hierakonpolis in Upper Egypt cleared trees and built dykes, canals, and
early irrigation systems. By about 3500 BCE, they used these methods to
quadruple the amount of cleared, arable land and could support
population densities of up to one thousand people per square mile. Just
as one example, recent archaeological finds at Hierakonpolis also show
evidence of both social differential and specialization with separate
burials for the settlement's elite, the oldest known painted tomb, and
the remnants of a large-scale brewery, capable of producing up to 300
gallons of beer a day. It is believed that early leaders in Naganda,
Hierakonpolis, and similar communities cemented their roles by claiming
control over the environment as rainmakers or commanders of the floods.
Over time, some of these leaders created **divine kingships**, asserting
their right to even more power and access to resources, power that they
legitimized by claiming special relationships with, or even descent
from, gods. Once Egypt was unified, pharaohs ruled as divine kings, as
the personification of the gods. They promised order in the universe.
When things went well, the pharaohs were credited with agricultural
productivity and the success of the state. There was no separation
between religion and the state in ancient Egypt.

The **Palette of Narmer** (see Figure 2.6 and Figure 2.7), which is used
to date the unification of Egypt, shows signs that King Narmer
legitimized his rule, in part, by claiming a special relationship with
the gods. King Narmer, who is referred to in some text as Menes, is
commonly recognized as the first unifier of Upper (to the south) and
Lower (to the north) Egypt in approximately 3100 BCE (see Map 2.7).
Unification brought together Egypt from the first cataract at Aswan to
the Nile Delta. The Palette of Narmer, which was found in Hierakonpolis,
shows King Narmer's conquest of both regions. The right side in Figure
2.6 shows him slaying an enemy of Upper Egypt. The largest figure,
Narmer is wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and beheading a rival king
while standing atop conquered enemies. The left side also shows him as a
conqueror, wearing the crown of Lower Egypt and directing flag bearers
to mark his victory. Religious imagery appears in the inclusion of the
goddess Hathor at the top of the palette as well as the falcon, a
reference to Horus, the patron god of Hierakonpolis, who later in
dynastic Egypt became the god of sun and kingship.

Both sides of the Palette of Narmer also have some of the earliest known
Hieroglyphs. **Hieroglyphics** emerged as written text, combining
pictograms (a pictorial symbol for a word or phrase) and phonograms (a
symbol representing a sound), during the period of unification. Tax
assessment and collection likely necessitated the initial development of
Hieroglyphics. Ancient Egyptians eventually used three different
scripts: Hieroglyphic, Hieratic, and Demotic. Hieroglyphics remained the
script of choice for ritual texts. Students of Egyptian history are most
familiar with Hieroglyphics as they were usually what artists used to
record the history of Egypt's elite. For example, skilled artisans used
Hieroglyphs to chronicle glorified accounts of their patrons' lives on
the sides of their tombs. The Egyptians developed Hieratic and Demotic,
the two other scripts, slightly later and used them for administrative,
commercial, and many other purposes. The Egyptian administration tended
to use ink and papyrus to maintain its official records. On the other
hand, literate people used ostraca, pieces of broken pottery and chips
of limestone, for less formal notes and communications. Over the past
decades, archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of ostraca that
start to tell us about the lives of the literate elite and skilled
craftsmen. Just like Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt had one of the oldest
written scripts found anywhere in the world.

In addition to one of the earliest writing systems and Egyptian paper
(papyrus), archaeologists have credited ancient Egyptians with a number
of other innovations. For construction purposes, ancient Egyptians
invented the ramp and lever. They also developed a 12-month calendar
with 365 days, glassmaking skills, arithmetic (including one of the
earliest decimal systems) and geometry, and medical procedures to heal
broken bones and relieve fevers. Finally, Egyptians used stone-carving
techniques and other crafting skills and tools that were shared
throughout the Mediterranean.

## 2.14 DYNASTIC EGYPT

Scholars break the 1500 years following unification, a time known as
dynastic Egypt, into three main periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 2660--2160
BCE), the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040--1640 BCE), and the New Kingdom (c.
1530--1070 BCE). There is some disagreement about the exact dates of the
periods, but in general, these spans denote more centralized control
over a unified Egypt. During dynastic Egypt, pharaohs ruled a united
Upper and Lower Egypt. In between these periods of centralized control
were intermediate periods, during which the Egyptian pharaohs had less
authority. The intermediate periods were characterized by political
upheaval and military violence, the latter often at least partially
resulting from foreign invasions.

Striking continuities existed in Egypt throughout the Old Kingdom, the
Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. Egypt had stable population
numbers, consistent social stratification, pharaohs---who exercised
significant power---and a unifying religious ideology, which linked the
pharaohs to the gods. As Egypt transitioned from the period of
unification under King Narmer to the Old Kingdom, the pharaohs and the
elite became increasingly wealthy and powerful. They further developed
earlier systems of tax collection, expanded the religious doctrine, and
built a huge state bureaucracy.

Social distinctions and hierarchies remained fairly consistent through
all of dynastic Egypt. Most people were rural peasant farmers. They
lived in small mud huts just above the floodplain and turned over
surplus agricultural produce to the state as taxes. When they were not
farming, they were expected to perform rotating service for the state,
by, for example, working on a pharaoh's tomb, reinforcing dykes, and
helping in the construction of temples. The labor of the majority of the
population supported the more elite and skilled classes, from the
pharaoh down through the governing bureaucrats, priests, nobles,
soldiers, and skilled craftspeople, especially those who worked on
pyramids and tombs.

than 15 miles wide and often considerably less, encouraged high
population densities close to the Nile River. Author: Jeff Dahl Source:

</figure>

Another continuity in dynastic Egypt was the relative equality of women
to men. At least compared to women in other ancient societies, women in
ancient Egypt had considerable legal rights and freedoms. Men and women
did generally have different roles; Egyptian society charged men with
providing for the family and women with managing the home and children.
Society's ascribed gender roles meant that women were usually defined
primarily by their husbands and children, while men were defined by
their occupations. This difference could leave women more economically
vulnerable than men. For example, in the village of craftspeople who
worked on the pharaoh's tomb at Deir el Medina, houses were allocated to
the men who were actively employed. This system of assigning housing
meant that women whose husbands had died would be kicked out of their
homes as replacement workers were brought in. Despite some
vulnerability, Egyptian law was pretty equal between the sexes when it
came to many other issues. Egyptian women could own property, and tax
records show that they did. Egyptian women could also take cases to
court, enter into legally binding agreements, and serve actively as
priestesses. The pharaonic tradition includes some women, most famously
Hatshepsut, who ruled for twenty years in the fifteenth century BCE. One
last, perhaps surprising, legal entitlement of ancient Egyptian women
was their right to one-third of the property that a couple accumulated
over the course of their marriage. Married women had some financial
independence, which gave them options to dispose of their own property
or divorce. Therefore, while women did face constraints in terms of
their expected roles and had their status tied to the men in their
families, they nevertheless enjoyed economic freedoms and legal rights
not commonly seen in the ancient world.

While scholars working over the past several decades have used artwork,
archeology, and the surviving legal documents to draw conclusions about
women's roles in ancient Egypt, there is much ongoing debate about the
prevalence of slavery within this society. Part of the disagreement
stems from how various scholars define slavery. There is also great
uncertainty about the number of slaves within the Egyptian population.
The emerging consensus suggests that Egyptians increasingly used slaves
from the Middle Kingdom onward. The majority of the slaves in these
later dynasties were either prisoners of war or slaves brought from
Asia. Slaves performed many tasks. For example, they labored in
agricultural fields, served in the army, worked in construction, helped
their merchant owners in shops, and were domestic servants for the
Egyptian elite. Slaves were branded and, if possible, would be captured
and returned to their masters if they tried to escape. Some masters
undoubtedly abused their slaves, though the image of thousands of slaves
sacrificed to be buried with pharaohs incorrectly depicts dynastic
Egypt. Manumission (freeing a slave) was seemingly not very common, but
if they were freed, former slaves were not stigmatized; instead, they
were considered part of the general free population. These new scholarly
conclusions about the relatively small numbers of slaves in Egypt,
especially during the Old Kingdom, have impacted our understanding of
how pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed during dynastic Egypt.

The **Old Kingdom** saw pharaohs harness their influence to build
**pyramids** to emphasize their relationship to the divine and
facilitate their ascent to the gods after their earthly deaths.
Pyramids, with their distinctive shape, which you can see in Figure 2.9,
contained tombs for the pharaohs and their wives. They were marvels of
engineering, built on a massive scale to honor the pharaohs and usher
them into the afterlife. Pharaohs were mummified to preserve their
bodies and were buried with everything considered necessary for the
afterlife, including furniture, jewelry, makeup, pottery, food, wine,
clothing, and sometimes even pets. The most recognizable pyramids from
the Old Kingdom are the three pyramids at the Giza complex, which were
built for a father (Egyptian pharaoh Khufu) and his son and grandson,
who all ruled during the fourth dynasty.

The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu, is the largest of
the three pyramids. Still largely intact today, it was the largest
building in the world until the twentieth century. Over 500 feet high,
it covered an area of 200 square yards and was built with over 600 tons
of limestone. Recent studies on the construction of the pyramids have
put much more emphasis on the roles of skilled craftsmen---who might
have worked at multiple pyramid sites over the course of their
lifetimes---and rotating groups of unskilled workers than on slaves.
These studies suggest that skilled craftsmen and local labor forces of
Egyptians were the primary builders of the pyramids, including the Great
Pyramid of Giza. The Great Pyramid of Giza took an estimated 20 years to
construct and employed skilled stonemasons, architects, artists, and
craftsmen, in addition to the thousands of unskilled laborers who did
the heavy moving and lifting. The construction of the Great Pyramid of
Giza was an enormous, expensive feat. The pyramid stands as testimony to
the increased social differentiation, the great power and wealth of the
Egyptian pharaohs, and the significance of beliefs in the afterlife
during the Old Kingdom.

In addition to the construction of pyramids, the Old Kingdom saw
increased trade and remained a relatively peaceful period. The pharaoh's
government controlled trade, with Egypt exporting grain and gold (the
latter from Nubia to the south) and importing timber, spices, ivory, and
other luxury goods. During the Old Kingdom, Egypt did not have a
standing army and faced few foreign military threats. Lasting almost 400
years, the Old Kingdom saw the extension of the pharaoh's power,
especially through the government's ability to harness labor and control
trade. However, the power of the pharaohs began to wane in the fifth
dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Continuing environmental change that led to
droughts and famine, coupled with the huge expense of building pyramids,
likely impoverished pharaohs in the last centuries of the Old Kingdom.
Additionally, the governors known as *nomes*, who administered Egypt's
42 provinces from the fifth dynasty onward, became more independent and
took over functions that had been overseen by the state. As an added
blow, the pharaohs lost control of trade. While dynastic leaders still
referred to themselves as pharaohs, they lacked central authority over a
unified Egypt by 2180 BCE.

Following the decentralized First Intermediate Period of roughly 150
years, Pharaoh Mentohotep II reunified Egypt to found the **Middle
Kingdom**. The Middle Kingdom saw the reorganization of the state's
bureaucratic apparatus to control the *nomes.* To further strengthen
their authority, the pharaohs also moved their capital from the Old
Kingdom capital of Thebes south to Lisht, halfway between Upper and
Lower Egypt. With military expeditions, they extended the boundaries of
the state north to Lebanon and south to the second cataract of the Nile
into a region known as Nubia. With this extension of territory, Egypt
had access to more trade goods, and the organization of trade shifted so
that professional merchants took a leading role in developing new trade
routes. These professional merchants paid taxes to the state, supporting
further consolidation of power by the pharaohs and also infrastructural
improvements like irrigation. During the Middle Kingdom, the pharaohs
focused less on the building of massive pyramids and more on
administrative reorganization, military expeditions, and the state's
infrastructural repair. Disputes over succession and ineffectual rulers
led into the Second Intermediate Period. Most notably, Egypt was invaded
from both the north and the south during this period. The Hyksos invaded
from the north in 1670 BCE. They brought bronze and horse-drawn
chariots, which allowed them to conquer parts of Lower Egypt and
establish their own kingdom, one lasting about 100 years in the Nile
Delta region. From the south, the Kingdom of Kush, based in Nubia,
invaded and temporarily established control over Upper Egypt to Aswan.
Thus, foreign rulers dominated much of Egypt during the Second
Intermediate Period.

The **New Kingdom** of reunified Egypt that began in 1530 BCE saw an era
of Egyptian imperialism, changes in the burial practices of pharaohs,
and the emergence of a brief period of state-sponsored monotheism under
Pharaoh Akhenaten. In 1530 BCE, the pharaoh who became known as Ahmose
the Liberator (Ahmose I) defeated the Hyksos and continued sweeping up
along the eastern Mediterranean. By 1500 BCE, the Egyptian army had also
pushed into Nubia, taking Kush southward to the fourth cataract of the
Nile River (see Map 2.8). As pharaohs following Ahmose I continued
Egypt's expansion, the Imperial Egyptian army ran successful campaigns
in Palestine and Syria, along the eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, by
expanding into Kush, Egypt controlled trade routes into sub-Saharan
Africa. Adopting the Hyksos' chariot military and metal technologies
contributed to the Egyptian ability to strengthen its military. Egypt
maintained a large standing army and built an expansive empire during
the New Kingdom.

Egypt saw many other developments during the New Kingdom, especially
when it came to burial practices and religion. During the New Kingdom,
pharaohs and Egyptian elites used the **Valley of the Kings**, located
across the Nile River from Thebes, as their preferred burial site. They
desired tombs that were hidden away and safe from tomb robbers.
Therefore, instead of pyramids, they favored huge stone tombs built into
the mountains of the Valley of the Kings. Nearly all of the tombs in the
Valley of the Kings were raided, so the fears of the pharaohs were
well-founded. Tomb raiding was even common during dynastic Egypt. King
Tutankhamen's tomb has become one familiar exception. His tomb fared
unusually well over the millennia, and King Tutankhamen's image is well
known to us because his tomb was found mostly intact in 1922.

Throughout dynastic Egypt, much continuity existed in religious beliefs,
causing scholars to characterize Egyptian society as conservative,
meaning that Egyptians shied away from change. In general, Egyptian
religious beliefs emphasized unity and harmony. Throughout the dynastic
period, Egyptians thought that the soul contained distinct parts. They
believed that one part, the *ka,* was a person's lifeforce and that it
separated from the body after death. The Egyptians carried out their
elaborate preservation of mummies and made small tomb statues to house
their *ka* after death. The *ba,* another part of the soul, was the
unique character of the individual, which could move between the worlds
of the living and the dead. They believed that after death, if rituals
were carried out correctly, their *ka* and *ba* would reunite to
reanimate their *akh,* or spirit. If they observed the proper rituals
and successfully passed through Final Judgment (where they recited the
42 "Negative Confessions" and the god Osiris weighed their hearts
against a feather), Egyptians believed that their resurrected spirit,
their *akh*, would enter the afterlife. In contrast to Mesopotamian
society, Egyptians conceptualized the afterlife as pleasant. In the
afterlife, they expected to find a place with blue skies, agreeable
weather, and familiar objects and people. They also expected to complete
many of the everyday tasks, such as farming, and enjoy many of the same
recognizable pastimes. Throughout the centuries, the Egyptians
conceptualized the afterlife as a comfortable mirror image of life.

</figure>

One change that occurred over time was the "democratization of the
afterlife." As time progressed through the Middle Kingdom and into the
New Kingdom, more and more people aspired to an afterlife. No longer was
an afterlife seen as possible for only the pharaoh and the elite of
society. Instead, just about all sectors of society expected access, as
evident in the increased use of funeral texts, like the *Book of the
Dead*. People of varying means would slip papyrus with spells or prayers
from the *Book of the Dead* (or a similar text) into coffins and burial
chambers. They intended these spells to help their deceased loved ones
make it safely through the underworld into the pleasant afterlife.
Conceptualizations of the afterlife consistently emphasized its
familiarity and beauty, while more people looked forward to this
continued existence after their earthly deaths.

As they developed religious doctrine and came into contact with new
deities, Egyptians integrated new gods and goddesses into their
religious beliefs. Like ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians were
polytheistic. Some of the roles and back-stories of the deities did
change over time; nevertheless, over the millennia they remained quite
consistent. For example, Re, Osiris, Horus, and Isis, just to name a few
deities in the Egyptian pantheon, stayed significant throughout dynastic
Egypt. Re was the sun god; Osiris was the god of the afterworld, who
also controlled nature's cycles (like the all-important flooding of the
Nile); Horus became a god of war and protection; and Isis was a goddess
associated with healing and motherhood. During the Middle Kingdom, Amun,
initially a patron saint of the city of Thebes and later recognized as
the father of the pharaoh, was combined with Re, the sun god, to become
Amun-Re, the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon. Amun-Re retained this
place at the top of the Egyptian pantheon through most of the New
Kingdom. One major exception occurred during the reign of Pharaoh
Akhenaten.

Pharaoh Akhenaten started what is known as the **Amarna Period**. The
Amarna Period, which lasted from approximately 1350 to 1325 BCE, stands
out for its state-sponsored monotheism. Akhenaten introduced radical
changes to Egyptian society, moving the capital to Tell el Amarna, a new
settlement in the middle of the desert that was devoted to the worship
of Aten and the recognition of the pharaoh's superiority over everyone
else. **Aten**, who had been one of many deities worshipped during the
Middle Kingdom, was elevated to the creator god associated with
sunlight, the foundation of all life. "The Great Hymn to Aten" explains
the god Aten's association with the sun as, like the sun, his "rays
embraced the lands" of Egypt. "The Great Hymn to Aten."
[^\[8\]^](#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_footnote-243-8 "http://web.archive.org/web/19990221040703/http://puffin.creighton.edu/theo/simkins/tx/Aten.html"){#chapter-002-unknown.xhtml_return-footnote-243-8
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 8"} Akhenaten had the Great Temple of
Aten built in the middle of the new capital, and unlike previous
temples, this one had no roof and was open to sunlight. Akhenaten
further modified Egyptian religious doctrine to identify himself as the
son of Aten. According to the new religious ideology, Akhenaten alone
was able to ensure access to the afterlife and communicate with Aten,
the sole god. To reinforce Aten's singularity, Akhenaten withdrew
financial support from temples dedicated to other deities and defaced
the temples dedicated to Amun, who had previously been the most dominant
Egyptian deity. The prominence of Aten and Akhenaten's exclusive access
to him define the Amarna Period.

Why did Akhenaten introduce these radical changes? At least in part,
Akhenaten wanted to break with the priests in Thebes who controlled the
temples dedicated to Amun because he believed that these priests had
become too powerful. Additionally, by taking on the role of the son of
Aten and regulating entry into the afterlife, Akhenaten certainly
attempted to reformulate beliefs to emphasize his own importance.

Akhenaten's radical changes were likely troubling for most of the
Egyptian population. They had previously found comfort in their access
to deities and their regular religious rituals. The worship of Aten as
the only Egyptian god did not last more than a couple of decades,
floundering after the death of Akhenaten. Pharaohs who ruled from 1323
BCE onward tried not only to erase the religious legacies of the Amarna
Period but also to destroy the capital at Tell el Amarna and remove
Akhenaten from the historical record. Archaeologists have not found
Akhenaten's tomb or burial place. Scholars continue a long-standing
debate about how this brief period of Egyptian monotheism relates (if at
all) to the monotheism of the Israelites. Despite such uncertainties,
study of the Amarna Period does indicate that Egyptians in the
fourteenth century BCE saw the fleeting appearance of religious ideology
that identified Aten as the singular god.

Some of the strongest rulers of the New Kingdom, including Ramses I and
Ramses II, came to power after the Amarna Period. These pharaohs
expanded Egypt's centralized administration and its control over foreign
territories. However, by the twelfth century BCE, weaker rulers, foreign
invasions, and the loss of territory in Nubia and Palestine indicated
the imminent collapse of the New Kingdom. In the Late Period that
followed (c. 1040 to 332 BCE), the Kingdom of Kush, based in Nubia,
invaded and briefly ruled Egypt until the Assyrians conquered Thebes,
establishing their own rule over Lower Egypt. Egyptian internal revolts
and the conquest by Nubia and the Assyrian Empire left Egypt susceptible
to invasion by the Persians and then eventually the 332 BCE invasion of
Alexander the Great. The ancient Egyptians made numerous contributions
to world history. We remember them for mummification, their pharaohs,
and the pyramids. Certainly, in this era, Egypt stands out for its
ability to produce agricultural surpluses that supported the elites,
priests, and skilled craftspeople. While we tend to focus on the
bureaucratic, religious, and artistic contributions of these classes,
all Egyptians played crucial roles in creating and maintaining this
sophisticated civilization. Additionally, the innovations of
Egyptians---such as their stone-carving techniques, Hieroglyphics, the
use of papyrus, their knowledge of the length of a solar year, and their
construction methods---influenced the ancient world and still inspire
awe. Overall, the ancient Egyptians created a vibrant civilization,
while they also found comfort in the familiar and traditional.

## 2.15 NUBIA: THE KINGDOMS OF KERMA AND KUSH

The region south of Aswan, at the first cataract of the Nile River, is
commonly called **Nubia**. Nubia is notable for its long-term, dynamic
relationship with ancient Egypt. Just as importantly, Nubia was also the
site of an early civilization. The kingdoms of Kerma (c. 2400 BCE to
1500 BCE) and Kush (c. 1000 BCE to 300 CE) emerged along the Nile River.
These kingdoms prospered especially due to their productive agriculture
and the region's copious natural resources. At certain points, both
Kerma and Kush were strong enough to successfully invade Egypt. These
kingdoms in Nubia also developed their own religious and cultural
traditions, including a written script, Meroitic. While the people of
this region, known collectively as Nubians, borrowed heavily from the
Egyptians, Nubians also had distinctive practices that set their
civilization apart from that of their northern neighbors.

Scholars generally link the origins of ancient Kerma (in present-day
Sudan) back to the desiccation of the Sahara Desert and the rise of
dynastic Egypt. Similar to ancient Egypt, the drying out of the region
encouraged people to move closer to the Nile River in the years between
5,000 and 4,000 BCE. Rock paintings showing cattle in areas that have
been desert for thousands of years attest to the environmental changes
in Nubia and also the development of a cattle culture that dates back to
at least the fourth millennium BCE. Just as in Egypt, the desiccation of
the Sahara Desert drew together people from all directions. As people
settled closer to the Nile River in Nubia, they brought their cattle,
their agricultural traditions, and their languages, building settlements
with higher population densities.

Additionally, Egyptian elites desired ivory, animal skins, incense, and
other luxury goods, prompting trade between Nubia and Egypt that
pre-dated the unification of Egypt. With an increased demand for luxury
goods as social stratification grew, the Egyptians even ran military
forays into Nubia. After unification, the Egyptians continued to invade
Nubia to trade and raid for slaves and cattle. Likely, Nubian desires to
control trade and protect themselves from Egyptian raids further
compelled state formation in Nubia. Without Nubian written records from
the third millennium BCE, it is difficult to identify additional reasons
why the state arose. However, archeological evidence does clearly
indicate that by about 2400 BCE, Nubians had formed the Kingdom of Kerma
between the third and fourth cataracts of the Nile River.

### 2.15.1 Kerma (c. 2400 BCE to c. 1500 BCE)

**Kerma** endured in Upper Nubia for almost a thousand years. The
kingdom is named after its capital city at Kerma at the third cataract,
but excavations at other sites (where similar pottery styles and burial
sites have been found) suggest that at its height Kerma's reach may have
extended more than 200 miles southward past the fifth cataract of the
Nile River. So far, archaeological evidence indicates that, with the
exception of the capital and perhaps one or two other cities, most of
the people in Kerma lived in smaller villages. They grew crops like
barley and kept goats, sheep, and cattle, sending tribute to their
capital. The people of Kerma also developed industries, especially in
mining, metalworking, and pottery. Kerma was linked inter-regionally
through trade to its tributary villages, to dynastic Egypt, and to
sub-Saharan Africa. Egyptian pharaohs and elites wanted the gold,
copper, slaves, ivory, exotic animals, and more that they obtained from
Kerma.

The people of Kerma also made use of their location on the Nile and
proximity to Egypt as they imported textiles, jewelry, and other
manufactured goods. Presumably, one reason that Nubian leaders built
their ancient capital at Kerma was to oversee river trade. At the
impassable cataract, boat owners unloaded their cargo and took it
overland past the shallows and rocks before again proceeding on the
water. This location at the cataract gave the leaders at Kerma the
chance to tax, divert, and register goods being transported between
Kerma and Egypt.

Agricultural surpluses and other tributary payments supported the rulers
and elites of the capital. Archaeologists have shown that the capital
had defenses, including ditches, ramparts, and massive walls with
towers. There were also palaces within the city and on its outskirts.
However, the most famous structure is the Western Deffufa (Figure 2.13)
made of mud-bricks, which likely served as a temple. Two other
deffufa---large mud-brick structures with spaces for rituals on
top---have been at least partially excavated within the vicinity of
Kerma. Another notable archaeological find is the Eastern Cemetery,
which lies a couple of miles to the east of the city. It served as the
burial site for Kerma's rulers for almost a thousand years and contains
over 30,000 tombs. Some of the tombs were covered with large mounds.
Demonstrating the cattle culture of the region, dozens of cattle skulls
encircle a number of the tombs. Tombs also contain the remains of human
sacrifices and other symbols of wealth and status, like jewelry made of
gold and silver. The largest tomb found to date is 300 feet in diameter
and covered with black granite, white quartz pebbles, and a marble top.
Its interior burial suite contains semi-precious stones, bronze weapons,
and lavish furniture. In the corridor leading into the underground
burial site, archaeologists unearthed the remains of horses, dogs, and
about 400 human sacrificial victims. The cattle skulls, mounds, and
remains of human sacrifices have led scholars to suggest that the Kerma
elite had their own styles for monumental structures like the Western
Deffufa and their tombs, even though they sometimes employed Egyptian

It appears that Kerma was strongest when neighboring Egypt was weak. As
a case in point, during Egypt's Second Intermediate Period, Kerma, at
the height of its power, successfully invaded parts of Upper Egypt and
established diplomatic relations with the occupying Hyksos. Once
reunified during the New Kingdom, Egypt retaliated by conquering Kerma
to the fourth cataract. Then, Egypt occupied Kerma for the next 500
years. During the Egyptian occupation, the elite classes of Kerma
adopted many elements of Egyptian culture, including Egyptian gods,
styles of dress, Hieroglyphics, and the Egyptian language. However,
scholars believe that the Nubian masses retained their own distinctive
identity with their local language and customs.

### 2.15.2 The Kingdom of Kush

As Egypt entered its Third Intermediate Period, Nubians gradually
established their independence, eventually creating a new state, the
Kingdom of **Kush**, in the eighth century BCE. The initial capital of
the Kingdom of Kush was Napata (c. 750 BCE to 593 BCE). From Napata, the
Nubians took control of Upper Egypt, establishing the "Ethiopian
Dynasty," which ruled for 60 years from Thebes. Assyrian invasions
destabilized the Nubian rulers in Thebes, causing the last pharaoh of
the Ethiopian Dynasty to flee to Napata. Then, once strengthened, the
Egyptians pushed back. The Egyptian army sacked Napata in 593 BCE, and
in response, the Nubian rulers moved their capital farther south to
Meroe. (See Map 2.9.) At this southern location, they further developed
their civilization, which lasted until the fourth century CE.

With the new capital at **Meroe**, a location with well-watered farmland
and some distance between it and Egypt, the Kingdom of Kush flourished.
Meroe got more rainfall than Napata and was not as dependent on the Nile
floods. Nubians were able to extend the areas under cultivation and grow
a wider variety of crops, like cotton, sorghum, and millet. They were
also able to easily graze their livestock, and as a result, during this
period, cattle became even more important as a symbol of their culture
and wealth.

After moving the capital to Meroe, the culture of Kush showed more
independence from Egypt as well. Particularly as Egypt's power declined,
the people of Kush put more emphasis on their own deities and pushed
Egyptian gods to the background. For example, temples devoted to a
Nubian war god, Apedamak, "the Lion of the South," received more support
and even used live lions for rituals. Gold, long mined and valuable in
the region, remained important while the people of Kush continued to
develop additional industries. The area was rich in iron ore and the
hardwoods used to make charcoal, which encouraged the growth of a
booming iron industry. They made iron weapons and tools that they used
for defense and to increase their crop yields. They were able to trade
their agricultural surpluses, iron, cattle, and exotic things like
elephants from sub-Saharan Africa with Egypt, Greece, Rome, and India,
bringing great wealth and prestige to Meroe. Also, the rulers of Meroe
commissioned pyramids but had them built in a local style. Inevitably,
there is often a one-sided and incomplete comparison with Egypt, but
this comparison can be helpful. As evident in Figure 2.14, their
pyramids were smaller and had a unique shape. Kush burial practices were
different than those used in dynastic Egypt, as corpses were not always
mummified and were buried in the fetal position. Finally, a new
locally-created written script, Meroitic, replaced the use of Egyptian
Hieroglyphics by 300 BCE. Modern scholars have not yet translated
Meroitic, and students of their culture will surely learn even more
about the Kingdom of Kush once scholars have done so. As for now, we
know that very productive agriculture, local rituals and burial
practices, the growth of industries, social stratification facilitated
by Meroe's wealth and extensive trade networks, and the written script
Meroitic were some of the distinctive elements of the civilization at
Kush.

</figure>

While the Greeks and Romans occasionally sent raiding parties into
Nubia, for a while, Meroe's southern location helped isolate it from
conquest. Legends also emphasize the strength of Meroe's army and the
physical prowess of its soldiers. Environmental changes, internal
rivalries, and the rise of Axum (a new state to the east) likely all
contributed to the fairly abrupt collapse of Meroe in the fourth century
CE.

Egyptian sources were generally very derogatory in their portrayal of
Nubians, and even a few early twentieth-century archaeologists
carelessly (and incorrectly) identified these Nubian kingdoms as slave
colonies of the Egyptians. However, the kingdoms of Kerma and Kush were
known in the ancient world for their wealth and industries. The wealth
garnered through productive agriculture and trade supported a ruling
class, great artists, and monumental architecture. Egyptian culture was
influential, but Nubians adopted Egyptian practices to meet their own
needs and sensibilities. Often entangled with Egypt and sometimes
defending themselves from other invaders as well, these two kingdoms
persisted for hundreds of years, creating an independent civilization
along the southern stretches of the Nile River.

## 2.16 SUMMARY

Between about 4000 and 3000 BCE, civilizations emerged in the fertile
river valleys of Mesopotamia and Northeast Africa. These civilizations
had common elements, including food surpluses, higher population
densities, social stratification, systems of taxation, labor
specialization, regular trade, and written scripts.

In areas adjacent to the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Mesopotamians
built city-states by 3500 BCE. While Sumerian traditions influenced
developments throughout the region, other cities emerged and refined
their own institutions and beliefs. Archaeological finds and records in
the *cuneiform* script show the significance of the temple complex and
religious leaders throughout Mesopotamia. Kingship, with hereditary
rulers who claimed control over multiple city-states and special
relationships with the gods, was just one significant political
innovation in the region. History credits Sargon of Akkad with founding
the first empire in Mesopotamia. Thereafter, a succession of empires
rose and fell, demonstrating the dynamic nature of Mesopotamian
societies. According to Hebrew tradition, Abraham led his followers from
the city of Ur in Mesopotamia, and they eventually settled in the
Levant. Several generations later, according to Hebrew tradition, the
Israelites went to Egypt, where they suffered persecution and
enslavement until Moses liberated them. Upon their return to Canaan, the
Israelites built kingdoms just prior to 1000 BCE. Their kingdoms formed
complex administrations and were unified by powerful kings, such as the
well-known King Solomon. Historians also recognize countless other
contributions made by the Israelites, especially as regards monotheistic
religious traditions and Western understandings of justice.

The unification of Egypt in approximately 3100 BCE witnessed the
emergence of civilizations in Northeast Africa. In Nubia to the south of
Egypt, Africans built another civilization with the kingdoms of Kerma
and Kush. The people in each of these civilizations made good use of the
agriculturally productive floodplains of the Nile River. Egypt and the
kingdoms in Nubia influenced one another; they traded and intermittently
claimed control over each other's territory. While we may be more
familiar with the pharaohs, pyramids, and religious beliefs of ancient
Egypt, Nubians made their own contributions, like the Meroitic script
and unique architectural styles, to world history.

## 3.2 INTRODUCTION: A POLITICAL OVERVIEW {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Our knowledge of the ancient world has been radically altered by
impressive archaeological discoveries over the last two centuries. Prior
to the twentieth century, for instance, historians believed that India's
history began in the second millennium BCE, when a people known as
Indo-Aryans migrated into the Indian subcontinent and created a new
civilization. Yet, even during the nineteenth century, British explorers
and officials were curious about brick mounds dotting the landscape of
northwest India, where Pakistan is today. A large one was located in a
village named Harappa (see Figure 3.1). A British army engineer, Sir
Alexander Cunningham, sensed its importance because he also found other
artifacts among the bricks, such as a seal with an inscription. He was,
therefore, quite dismayed that railway contractors were pilfering these
bricks for ballast. When he became the director of Great Britain's
Archaeological Survey in 1872, he ordered protection for these ruins.
But the excavation of Harappa did not begin until 1920, and neither the
Archaeological Survey nor Indian archaeologists understood their
significance until this time. Harappa, it turned out, was an ancient
city dating back to the third millennium BCE and only one part of a much
larger civilization sprawling over northwest India. With the discovery
of this lost civilization, the timeline for India's history was pushed
back over one thousand years.

The Indus Valley Civilization (2600--1700 BCE) now stands at the
beginning of India's long history. Much like the states of ancient
Mesopotamia and Egypt, the foundations for that history were established
by Paleolithic foragers who migrated to and populated the region and
then Neolithic agriculturalists who settled into villages. During the
third millennium BCE, building on these foundations, urban centers
emerged along the Indus River, along with other elements that contribute
to making a civilization.

</figure>

This civilization, however, faded away by 1700 BCE and was followed by a
new stage in India's history. While it declined, India saw waves of
migration from the mountainous northwest by a people who referred to
themselves as Aryans. The Aryans brought a distinctive language and way
of life to the northern half of India and, after first migrating into
the Punjab and Indus Valley, pushed east along the Ganges River and
settled down into a life of farming and pastoralism. As they interacted
with indigenous peoples, a new period in India's history took shape.
That period is known as the Vedic Age (1700--600 BCE).

During the long course of the Vedic Age, states formed in northern
India. The surplus from farming and pastoralism allowed people to engage
in a multitude of other occupations and made for a lively trade.
Villages thus grew in number, and some became towns. Consequently, there
was a need for greater leadership, something that was provided by
chieftains of the many Aryan clans. Over time, higher levels of
political organization developed, and these chieftains became kings or
the leaders of clan assemblies. By the end of the Vedic Age, northern
India was divided up by sixteen major kingdoms and oligarchies.

The ensuing three centuries (c. 600--321 BCE) were a time of transition.
These states fought with each other over territory. The most successful
state was the one that could most effectively administer its land,
mobilize its resources, and field the largest armies. That state was the
kingdom of Magadha, which by the fourth century BCE had gained control
of much of northern India along the Ganges River.

In 321 BCE, the last king of Magadha was overthrown by one of his
subjects, Chandragupta Maurya, and a new period in India's history
began. Through war and diplomacy, he and his two successors established
control over most of India, forging the first major empire in the
history of South Asia: the Mauryan Empire (321--184 BCE). Chandragupta's
grandson, King Ashoka, ended the military conquests and sought to rule
his land through Buddhist principles of non-violence and tolerance. But
after his time, the empire rapidly declined, and India entered a new
stage in its history.

After the Mauryan Empire fell, no one major power held control over a
substantial part of India for five hundred years. Rather, from c. 200
BCE to 300 CE, India saw a fairly rapid turnover of numerous regional
kingdoms. Some of these were located in northern India, along the Ganges
River, but others grew in southern India for the first time. Also, some
kingdoms emerged through foreign conquest. Outsiders in Central Asia and
the Middle East saw India as a place of much wealth and sought to
plunder it or rule it. Thus, throughout its history, India was
repeatedly invaded by conquerors coming through mountain passes in the
northwest. Many of these, like King Kanishka of the Kushan Empire (c.
100 CE), established notable kingdoms that extended from India into
these neighboring regions from which they came.

Even after 300 CE and up to the fifteenth century, India was never again
unified for any length of time by one large empire. For that reason,
historians highlight those kingdoms that became substantial regional
powers and contributed in other important ways to India's civilization.
The period 300--600 CE, for instance, is often referred to as the Gupta
period and classical age. The Guptas (c. 320--550) were rulers who
forged an impressive empire in northern India. As their empire
flourished, Indian intellectuals were also setting standards for
excellence in the fields of art, architecture, literature, and science,
in part because of Gupta patronage. But important kingdoms also
developed in south India.

The last period covered in this chapter is early medieval India (c.
600--1300 CE). After the Gupta Empire, and during the following seven
centuries, the pattern of fragmentation intensified, as numerous
regional kingdoms large and small frequently turned over. Confronting
such an unstable and fluid political scene, medieval kings granted land
to loyal subordinate rulers and high officers of their courts. The
resulting political and economic pattern is referred to as Indian
feudalism. Also, kings put their greatness on display by waging war and
building magnificent Hindu temples in their capital cities. And during
the medieval period, a new political and religious force entered the
Indian scene, when Muslim Arab and Turkic traders and conquerors arrived
on the subcontinent.

This overview briefly summarizes major periods in India's political
history. But the history of a civilization consists of more than just
rulers and states, which is why historians also pay close attention to
social, cultural, and economic life every step of the way. This
attention is especially important for India. Although the Asian
subcontinent saw a long succession of kingdoms and empires and was
usually divided up by several at any particular point in its history,
peoples over time came to share some things in common. Socially, the
peoples of India were largely organized by the caste system. Culturally,
the peoples of India shared in the development of Hinduism and Buddhism,
two major religious traditions that shaped people's understanding of the
world and their place in it. Finally, throughout the ancient and
medieval periods, India flourished as a civilization because of its
dynamic economy. The peoples of India shared in that too, and that meant
they were linked in networks of trade and exchange not only with other
parts of South Asia but also with neighboring regions of the
Afro-Eurasian world.

## 3.5 WHAT IS INDIA? THE GEOGRAPHY OF SOUTH ASIA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

India's dynamic history, then, alternated between periods when the
subcontinent was partially unified by empires and periods when it was
composed of a shifting mosaic of regional states. This history was also
impacted by influxes of migrants and invaders. In thinking about the
reasons for these patterns, historians highlight the size of India and
its diverse geography and peoples.

It is important to remember that "**India**" can mean different things.
Today, India usually designates the nation-state of India (see Map 3.1).
But modern India only formed in 1947 and includes much less territory
than India did in ancient times. As a term, India was first invented by
the ancient Greeks to refer to the **Indus River** and the lands and
people beyond it. When used in this sense, India also includes today's
nation of Pakistan. In fact, for the purpose of studying earlier
history, India can be thought of as the territory that includes at least
seven countries today: India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri
Lanka, and the Maldives. This territory is also referred to as **South
Asia** or the Indian subcontinent.

The Indian subcontinent is where Indian civilization took shape. But
that civilization was not created by one people, race, or ethnic group,
and it doesn't make sense to see India's history as the history of one
Indian people. Rather, the history of this region was shaped by a
multitude of ethnic groups who spoke many different languages and lived
and moved about on a diverse terrain suited to many different kinds of
livelihood.

Large natural boundaries define the subcontinent. Mountain ranges ring
the north, and bodies of water surround the rest. To the east lies the
**Bay of Bengal**, to the south the Indian Ocean, and to the west the
Arabian Sea. The largest mountain range is the Himalaya, which defines
India's northern and northeastern boundary. A subrange of the
Himalaya---the **Hindu Kush**---sits at its western end, while a ridge
running from north to south defines the eastern end, dividing India from
China and mainland Southeast Asia. To the northwest, the Suleiman Range
and Kirthar Range complete what might seem like impassable barriers.
Yet, these ranges are punctuated by a few narrow passes that connect
India to Central Asia and West Asia.

To the south of the mountain ranges lie **the Indo-Gangetic Plain** and
the two great rivers of northern India that comprise it: the Indus River
and the **Ganges River**. These rivers originate in the Himalaya and are
regularly fed by snowmelt and monsoon rains. The Indus River, which is
located in the northwest and drains into the Arabian Sea, can be divided
into an upper and lower region. The region comprising the upper Indus
and its many tributary rivers is called the **Punjab**, while the region
surrounding the lower Indus is referred to as the **Sindh**. The Ganges
River begins in the western Himalaya and flows southeast across northern
India before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Because they could support
large populations, the plains surrounding these river systems served as
the heartland for India's first major states and empires.

Peninsular India is also an important part of the story because over
time great regional kingdoms also emerged in the south. The peninsula is
divided from northern India by the Vindhya Mountains, to the south of
which lies the **Deccan Plateau**. This arid plateau is bordered by two
coastal ranges---the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats, beyond which are
narrow coastal plains, the **Malabar** **Coast** and the **Coromandel
Coast**. This nearly 4600 miles of coastline is important to India's
history because it linked fishing and trading communities to the Indian
Ocean and, therefore, the rest of Afro-Eurasia. **Sri Lanka** is an
island located about thirty kilometers southeast of the southernmost tip
of India and also served as an important conduit for trade and cultural
contacts beyond India.

## 3.6 INDIA'S FIRST MAJOR CIVILIZATION: THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION (2600 BCE--1700 BCE) {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

A century of archaeological work in India that began in 1920
revealed [not
only]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}a lost
civilization but also a massive one, surpassing in size other major
early riverine civilizations of Afro-Eurasia, such as ancient Egypt and
the Mesopotamian states. In an area spanning roughly a half million
square miles, archaeologists have excavated thousands of settlements
(see Map 3.2). These can be envisioned in a hierarchy based on size and
sophistication. The top consists of five major cities of roughly 250
acres each. One of those is Harappa, and because it was excavated first,
the entire civilization was named the **Harappan Civilization**. The
bottom of the hierarchy consists of fifteen thousand smaller
agricultural and craft villages of about 2.5 acres each, while between
the top and bottom lie two tiers with several dozen towns ranging in
size from 15 to 150 acres. Because the majority of these settlements
were situated near the Indus River in the northwestern region of the
subcontinent, this civilization is also called the Indus Valley
Civilization.

As with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, archaeologists have been able to
sketch out how this civilization evolved out of the simpler agricultural
villages of the Neolithic period. On the subcontinent, farming and the
domestication of animals began c. 7000 BCE, about two thousand years
after they did in the Fertile Crescent. To the west of the Indus River,
along the foothills of Baluchistan, the remains of numerous small
villages have been found that date back to this time (see Map 3.3). One
of these is **Mehrgarh**. Here, villagers lived in simple mud-brick
structures, grew barley and wheat, and raised cattle, sheep, and goats.

Over the course of the next three thousand years, similar Neolithic
communities sprang up not only in northwest India but also in many other
locations on the subcontinent. But it was to the west of the Indus River
and then throughout neighboring fertile plains and valleys of the Punjab
and Sindh that we see the transition to a more complex, urban-based
civilization. Excavations throughout this region show a pattern of
development whereby settlements start looking more like towns than
villages: ground plans become larger, include the foundations of houses
and streets, and are conveniently located by the most fertile land or
places for trade. Similar artifacts spread over larger areas show that
the local communities building these towns were becoming linked together
in trade networks. Archaeologists date this transitional period when
India was on the verge of its first civilization from 5000 to 2600 BCE.
The mature phase, with its full-blown cities, begins from 2600 BCE,
roughly four centuries after the Sumerian city-states blossomed and
Egypt was unified under one kingdom.

towns and cities. Author: User “Avantiputra7” Source: Wikimedia Commons

</figure>

The ruins of **Mohenjo-Daro** and other Indus cities dating to this
mature phase suggest a vibrant society thriving in competently planned
and managed urban areas. Some of the principal purposes of these urban
settlements included coordinating the distribution of local surplus
resources, obtaining desired goods from more distant places, and turning
raw materials into commodities for trade. Mohenjo-Daro, for instance,
was located along the lower reaches of the Indus (see Figure 3.2). That
meant it was conveniently built amidst an abundance of resources:
fertile floodplains for agriculture, pasture for grazing domesticated
animals, and waters for fishing and fowling. The city itself consisted
of several mounds---elevated areas upon which structures and roads were
built. A larger mound served as a core, fortified area where public
functions likely took place. It contained a wall and large buildings,
including what archaeologists call a Great Bath and Great Hall. Other
mounds were the location of the residential and commercial sectors of
the city. Major avenues laid out on a grid created city blocks. Within a
block, multistory dwellings opening up to interior courtyards were
constructed out of mud bricks or bricks baked in kilns. Particular
attention was paid to public sanitation. Residences had not only private
wells and baths but also toilets drained by earthenware pipes that
ushered the sewage into covered drains located under the streets.

Farmers and pastoralists brought their grain and stock to the city for
trade or to place it in warehouses managed by the authorities. Laborers
dug the wells and collected trash from rectangular bins sitting beneath
rubbish chutes. Craftsmen worked copper and tin into bronze tools, fired
ceramics, and manufactured jewelry and beads out of gold, copper,
semi-precious stones, and ivory. Merchants traveling near and far
carried raw materials and finished goods by bullock carts or boats to
the dozens of towns and cities throughout the region.

Some goods also went to foreign lands. Harappan cities located along the
coast of the Arabian Sea engaged in coastal shipping that brought goods
as far as the Persian Gulf and the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers. In Mesopotamian city-states, Harappan seals and beads have been
found, and Mesopotamian sources speak of a certain place called
"Meluhha," a land with ivory, gold, and lapis lazuli. Cities like
Mohenjo-Daro were linked in networks of exchange extending in every
direction.

But unlike ancient Egypt and Sumer, this civilization has not yet
provided sources we can read, and this poses major problems of
interpretation---although over four thousand inscribed objects with at
least four hundred different signs recurring in various frequencies have
been found on clay, copper tablets, and small, square **seals**
excavated primarily at the major cities (see Figure 3.3). But the heroic
efforts of philologists to decipher the language have failed to yield
results. Thus, some historians call this civilization proto-historic,
distinguishing it from both prehistoric cultures that have no writing
and historic ones with written sources that we can read.

This proto-historical state of the evidence leaves many questions
concerning Harappan people's political organization and beliefs
unanswered. On the one hand, much uniformity in the archaeological
record across the region suggests coordination in planning---cities and
towns were similarly designed, fired bricks had the same dimensions, and
weights were standardized. On the other hand, the ruins lack structures
that can be clearly identified as palaces, temples, or large tombs. In
other words, there is little evidence for either a central political
authority ruling over an empire or for independent city-states. One
intriguing artifact found in Mohenjo-Daro is a small sculpture of a
bearded man made of soapstone (see Figure 3.4). The dignified appearance
suggests he may have been a priest or king, or even both. Perhaps he and
other priests purified themselves in the Great Bath for ritual purposes.
Yet, this is purely speculation, as the sculpture is unique. He may also
have been a powerful landowner or wealthy merchant who met with others
of a similar status in assemblies convened in the Great Hall of the
citadel. Perhaps local assemblies of just such elites governed each
city.

</figure>

Religious beliefs are also difficult to determine. Again, some of the
principal evidence consists of small artifacts such as figurines and the
square seals. The seals were carved out of a soft stone called steatite
and then fired so they would harden. They contain images of animals and
humans, typically with writing above. Mostly, they were used to imprint
the identity of a merchant or authorities on goods. However, some of the
images may have had religious significance. For example, hundreds of
"unicorn seals" display images of a mythical animal that resembles a
species of cattle (see Figure 3.5). These cattle are usually placed over
an object variously interpreted as a trough or altar. Perhaps these were
symbols of deities or animals used for sacrificial rituals. Equally as
interesting are the numerous female clay figurines. These may have been
used for fertility rituals or to pay homage to a goddess (see Figure
3.6).

The decline of the Harappan Civilization set in from 1900 BCE and was
complete two hundred years later. Stated simply, the towns and cities
and their lively trade networks faded away, and the region reverted to
rural conditions. Likely causes include geologic, climatic, and
environmental factors. Movement by tectonic plates may have led to
earthquakes, flooding, and shifts in the course of the Indus. Less
rainfall and deforestation may have degraded the environment's
suitability for farming. All of these factors would have impacted the
food supply. Consequently, urban areas and the civilization they
supported were slowly starved out of existence.

## 3.7 THE LONG VEDIC AGE (1700--600 BCE) {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

By 1700 BCE, the Harappan Civilization had collapsed. In northwest
India, scattered village communities engaging in agriculture and
pastoralism replaced the dense and more highly populated network of
cities, towns, and villages of the third millennium. The rest of
northern India too (including the Ganges River), as well as the entire
subcontinent, were similarly dotted with Neolithic communities of
farmers and herders. That is what the archaeological record
demonstrates.

The next stage in India's history is the **Vedic Age** (1700--600 BCE).
This period is named after a set of religious texts composed during
these centuries called the *Vedas*. The people who composed them are
known as the Vedic peoples and **Indo-Aryans**. They were not originally
from India but rather came as migrants traveling to the subcontinent via
mountain passes located in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Aryans first
settled in the Punjab, but then they pushed east along the Ganges,
eventually impressing their way of life, language, and religious beliefs
upon much of northern India. The course of India's history was
completely changed during this period. By the end of the Vedic Age,
numerous states had emerged, and **Hinduism** and the ***varna***
**social system** were beginning to take shape.

### 3.7.1 The Early Aryan Settlement of Northern India (1700--1000 BCE) {.import-Header3}

The early history of the Vedic Age offers the historian little primary
source material. For example, for the first half of the Vedic Age
(1700--1000 BCE), we are largely limited to archaeological sites and one
major text called the ***Rig Veda***. This is the first of four *Vedas.*
It consists of 1028 hymns addressed to the Vedic peoples' pantheon of
gods. But it wasn't actually written down until after 500 BCE. Rather,
from as early as the beginning of the second millennium BCE, these hymns
were orally composed and transmitted by Aryan poetseers, eventually
becoming the preserve of a few priestly clans who utilized them for the
specific religious function of pleasing higher powers. Thus, these hymns
only offer certain kinds of information. Yet, despite these limits,
historians have been able to sketch out the Aryans' way of life in these
early centuries as well as make solid arguments about how they came to
India.

The Indo-Aryans were pastoralists who migrated to India in waves
beginning c. 1700 BCE (see Map 3.4). They referred to themselves as
Aryans, a term meaning "noble" or "respectable." They spoke **Sanskrit**
and used it to transmit their sacred hymns. At first, in search of land,
they settled along the hills and plains of the upper reaches of the
Indus River and its tributaries, bringing with them their pastoral and
farming way of life. In their hymns, the Aryans beseech the gods to
bless them with cattle, bounteous harvests, rain, friends, wealth, fame,
and sons. From these, it is clear that herding was the principal
occupation, and cows were especially prized. But the Aryans also farmed,
as apparent in hymns that speak of plough teams and the cutting and
threshing of grain.

</figure>

During these early centuries, led by their pastoral chiefs, some Aryans
retained a semi-nomadic way of life, living in temporary dwellings and
then moving about with their herds or migrating further. Others settled
down in villages. In both cases, kinship was especially valued. At the
simplest level, society consisted of extended families of three
generations. Fathers were expected to lead the family as patriarchal
heads, while sons were expected to care for the herds, bring honor
through success in battle, and sacrifice for the well-being of their
fathers' souls after death. They also inherited the property and family
name. This suggests that, as is so often the case for ancient societies,
men were dominant and women were subordinate. Yet, women's roles weren't
as rigidly defined as they would be in later times, and they had some
choice in marriage and could remarry.

Several extended families, in turn, made up clans, and the members of a
clan shared land and herds. Groups of larger clans also constituted
tribes. The *Vedas* speak of rajas who, at this point, are best
understood as clan or tribal chieftains. These men protected their
people and led in times of battle, for the clans and tribes fought with
each other and with the indigenous villagers living in the northwest
prior to the Aryan migrations. In times of war, these chiefs would rely
on priests who ensured the support of the gods by reciting hymns and
sacrificing to them. At assemblies of kinsmen and other wealthy and
worthy men from the clan, the rajas distributed war booty. Sudas, for
example, was the chief of the Bharata clan. After settling in the
Punjab, the Bharatas were attacked by neighboring clan confederacies,
but drawing on his skills in chariot warfare and the support of priests,
Sudas successfully fought them off.

More than anything else, the *Rig Veda* reveals the Aryans' religious
ideas. For them, the universe was composed of the sky, earth, and
netherworld. These realms were populated by a host of divinities and
demons responsible for the good and evil and order and disorder
afflicting the human world. Although one Vedic hymn gives a total of
thirty-three gods, many more are mentioned. That means early Vedic
religion was polytheistic. These human-like powers lying behind all
those natural phenomena so close to a people living out on the plains
were associated with the forces of light, good, and order. By chanting
hymns to them and sacrificing in the correct way, the Aryan priests
might secure blessings for the people or prevent the demons and spirits
on earth from causing sickness and death. They might also ensure that
the souls of the dead would successfully reach the netherworld, where
the spirits of righteous Fathers feasted with King Yama, the first man
to die.

Approaching the gods required neither temples nor images. Rather, a fire
was lit in a specially prepared sacrificial altar. This might take place
in a home when the family patriarch was hoping for a son or on an open
plot of land when the clan chieftain wished to secure the welfare of his
people. Priests were called in to perform the ceremony. They would
imbibe a hallucinogenic beverage squeezed from a plant of uncertain
identity and chant hymns while oblations of butter, fruit, and meat were
placed in the fire. The gods, it was believed, would descend onto grass
strewn about for them and could partake of the offerings once they were
transmuted by the fire.

**Indra** was among the most beloved of the Vedic gods. As a god of war
and storm, and as king of the gods, Indra exemplified traits men sought
to embody in their lives. He is a great warrior who smites demons and
enemies but who also provides generously for the weak. Agni, another
favorite, was the god of fire and the household hearth. Agni summons the
gods to the sacrifice and, as intermediary between gods and humans,
brings the sacrificial offering to them.

### 3.7.2 The Origins of the Aryan People and the Indo-European Hypothesis {.import-Header3}

Because the Aryans came to India as migrating pastoralists from
mountainous regions to the northwest of the Indian subcontinent,
historians have sought to understand their origins. Sanskrit has
provided important clues because it contains features similar to
languages spoken at some point in Europe, Iran, and Central Asia. For
example, although they are vastly different languages, Latin, Persian,
and Sanskrit share similar sounds, vocabulary, and grammar.

On the basis of these shared traits, linguists have constructed a kind
of family tree that shows the historical relationship between these
languages. Sanskrit belongs to a group of languages used in northern
India called Indo-Aryan. These languages are closely related to
languages used throughout history in neighboring Iran. Together, all of
these are called the Indo-Iranian language group. This language group is
in turn one of nine branches of related language groups comprising the
**Indo-European language family**.

Linguists assume these distantly-related languages share a common
ancestor. They label that ancestral language proto-Indo-European and the
people who spoke it Indo-Europeans. They posit a scenario whereby, in
stages and over time, groups of these peoples migrated from their
homeland to neighboring areas and settled down. Since this process
happened over the course of many centuries and involved much interaction
with other peoples along the way, the ancestral language evolved into
many different ones while retaining some of the original features.

One question, then, is the location of this homeland and the history of
the peoples who spoke these languages as they changed. Many places have
been proposed, but at present, the most widely accepted scenario puts
this homeland in the steppe lands of southern Russia, just to the north
of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea (see Map 3.5).

Evidence from archaeological sites suggests that during the third
millennium, an Indo-European people lived in this region as semi-nomadic
pastoralists. They were likely the first to domesticate the horse and
also improved the chariot by adding lighter, spoked wheels. They lived
in tribes made up of extended families and worshipped numerous sky gods
by offering sacrifices in fire altars. At some point during this
millennium and over the course of several centuries, groups of these
peoples left their homeland and migrated south to the Iranian Plateau.
By 2000 BCE, Indo-Iranian-speaking pastoralists were living on the
Iranian Plateau and in Afghanistan. Some among these evolved into the
Indo-Aryan speakers living to the northwest of the Indus. It is these
peoples that began to arrive in the Punjab from c. 1700 BCE, with their
Vedic religion, kinship-based social order, and pastoral and farming way
of life.

### 3.7.3 The Later Vedic Age (1000--600 BCE) {.import-Header3}

During the early centuries of the Vedic Age, the world of the Aryan
tribes was the rural setting of the Punjab. Some settlers, however,
migrated east to the upper reaches of the Ganges River, setting the
stage for the next period in India's history, the later Vedic Age. The
later Vedic Age differs from the early Vedic Age in that during these
centuries, lands along the Ganges River were colonized by the Aryans,
and their political, economic, social, and religious life became more
complex.

Over the course of these four centuries, Aryan tribes, with horses
harnessed to chariots and wagons drawn by oxen, drove their herds east,
migrating along and colonizing the plains surrounding the Ganges.
Historians debate whether this happened through conquest and warfare or
intermittent migration led by traders and people seeking land and
opportunity. Regardless, by 600 BCE, the Aryans had reached the lower
reaches of the Ganges and as far south as the Vindhya Range and the
Deccan Plateau. Most of northern India would therefore be shaped by the
Aryan way of life. But in addition, as they moved into these areas, the
Aryans encountered indigenous peoples and interacted with them,
eventually imposing their way of life on them but also adopting many
elements of their languages and customs.

During this time, agriculture became more important and occupations more
diverse. As the lands were cleared, village communities formed. Two new
resources made farming more productive: iron tools and rice. Implements
such as iron axes and ploughs made clearing wilderness and sowing fields
easier, and rice paddy agriculture produced more calories per unit of
land. Consequently, the population began to grow, and people could more
easily engage in other occupations. By the end of this period, the
earliest towns had started to form.

Political changes accompanied economic developments. Looking ahead at
sixth-century northern India, the landscape was dominated by kingdoms
and oligarchies. That raises the question of the origins of these two
different kinds of states, where different types of central authority
formally governed a defined territory. Clearly, these states began to
emerge during the later Vedic Age, especially after the eighth century.

Prior to this state formation, chiefs (rajas) and their assemblies, with
the assistance of priests, saw to the well-being of their clans. This
clan-based method of governing persisted and evolved into oligarchies.
As the Aryans colonized new territory, clans or confederacies of clans
would claim it as their possession and name it after the ruling family.
The heads of clan families or chiefs of each clan in a confederacy then
jointly governed the territory by convening periodically in assembly
halls. A smaller group of leaders managed the deliberations and voting
and carried out the tasks of day-to-day governing. These kinds of states
have been called oligarchies because the heads of the most powerful
families governed. They have also been called republics because these
elites governed by assembly.

But in other territories, clan chiefs became kings. These kings elevated
themselves over kinsmen and the assemblies and served as the pivot of an
embryonic administrative system. Their chief priests conducted grand
rituals that demonstrated the king's special relation with the gods,
putting the people in awe of him and giving them the sense that they
would be protected. Treasurers managed the obligatory gifts kings
expected in return. Most importantly, kingship became hereditary, and
dynasties started to rule (see Map 3.6).

Society changed too. In earlier times, Aryan society was organized as a
fluid three-class social structure consisting of priests, warriors, and
commoners. But during the later Vedic Age, this social structure became
more hierarchical and rigid. A system for classifying people based on
broad occupational categories was developed by the religious and
political leaders in society. These categories are known as
***varnas***, and there were four of them: Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya,
and Shudra. The Brahmins were the priests, whose duty was to memorize
and orally transmit the *Vedas* and perform sacrifices so as to maintain
good relations with the gods. The Kshatriya were the chiefs and
warriors, whose duty was to govern well and fight. The Vaishya were
commoners who traded and farmed. They were responsible for society's
material prosperity. The Shudras were servants who labored for others,
usually as artisans or by performing menial tasks.

*Varnas* became hereditary social classes. That means a person was born
into one of these and usually remained there for life, pursuing an
occupation included in and marrying someone belonging to that *varna*.
*Varna* has also been translated as ritual status. Your *varna*
determined how pure or polluted you were and thus what level of
participation in rituals you would be allowed and also who you could
associate with. *Varna* thus defined a social hierarchy. The Brahmins
were the purest and most honored. Warriors were respected for their
leadership and supported the Brahmins, who affirmed their authority by
carrying out royal ceremonies. Together, they dominated society. The
Shudras (servants) were the most polluted and could not participate in
any sacrifice or speak freely to members of other *varnas*. Over time,
this way of organizing society came to be viewed as normal and natural.

During the later Vedic Age, the religion of the Aryans also developed in
new directions. As one of the world's major religious traditions,
**Hinduism** is multi-faceted and contains many layers of historical
development. The earliest layer is called **Brahmanism**. Brahmanism
begins with the *Rig Veda*, which presents a universe controlled by a
host of divinities. During the early Vedic Age, the Aryans explained the
world through myths about these higher powers, and their priests sought
to influence them through sacrificial ceremonies.

This early layer persisted and became even more elaborate. Three new
*Vedas* were added to the *Rig Veda*, as well as two sets of texts
called *Brahmanas* and ***Upanishads***. Combined, this literature,
which was composed in Sanskrit, constituted the full Vedic corpus.

The Brahmins weren't content with the 1028 hymns of the *Rig Veda*.
Later *Vedas* set the hymns to music, added prose formulas that were to
be uttered in the course of sacrificing to the divinities, and offered
spells and incantations for achieving such goals as warding off disease
and winning a battle. The *Brahmanas* were primarily handbooks of ritual
for the Brahmins. They explained the meaning of the sacrifices and how
to carry them out. Clearly, the Brahmins were becoming ever more
conscious of their role in keeping the universe in good working order by
pleasing and assisting the gods and consecrating kings. Their
sacrificial observances became all the more elaborate and an essential
component of good kingship.

The *Upanishads*, however, added an entirely new set of ideas. The title
means "sitting near" and points to a setting where sages conveyed
spiritual insights to students through dialogue, stories, and analogies.
The *Upanishads* are records of what was taught and discussed, the
earliest dating to the eighth and seventh centuries BCE. These sages
were likely hermits and wanderers who felt spiritually dissatisfied with
the mythological and ritualistic approach of Brahmanism. Rather, they
sought deeper insight into the nature of reality, the origins of the
universe, and the human condition. The concepts that appear throughout
these records of the outcome of their search are ***brahman*** (not to
be confused with Brahmins), ***atman***, **transmigration**, and
**karma**.

According to these sages, human beings face a predicament. The universe
they live in is created and destroyed repeatedly over the course of
immense cycles of time, and humans wander through it in an endless
succession of deaths and rebirths. This wandering is known as
transmigration, a process that isn't random but rather determined by the
law of karma. According to this law, good acts bring a better rebirth,
and bad acts a worse one. It may not happen in this lifetime, but one
day virtue will be rewarded and evil punished.

Ultimately, however, the goal is to be liberated from the cycle of death
and rebirth. According to Hindu traditions, the *Upanishads* reflect
spiritual knowledge that was revealed to sages who undertook an inward
journey through withdrawal from the world and meditation. What they
discovered is that one divine reality underlies the universe. They
called this ultimate reality *brahman*. They also discovered that deep
within the heart of each person lies the eternal soul. They called this
soul *atman*. Through quieting the mind and inquiry, the individual can
discover *atman* and its identity with *brahman*: the soul is the divine
reality. That is how a person is liberated from the illusion of endless
wandering.

In conclusion, by the end of the Vedic Age, northern India had undergone
immense changes. An Aryan civilization emerged and spread across the
Indo-Gangetic Plains. This civilization was characterized by the
Brahmins' religion (Brahmanism), the use of Sanskrit, and the *varna*
social system. The simpler rural life of the clans of earlier times was
giving way to the formation of states, and new religious ideas were
being added to the evolving tradition known today as Hinduism.

## 3.8 TRANSITION TO EMPIRE: STATES, CITIES, AND NEW RELIGIONS (600 TO 321 BCE) {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The sixth century begins a transitional period in India's history marked
by important developments. Some of these bring to fruition processes
that gained momentum during the late Vedic Age. Out of the hazy
formative stage of state development, sixteen powerful kingdoms and
oligarchies emerged. By the end of this period, one will dominate.
Accompanying their emergence, India entered a second stage of
urbanization, as towns and cities became a prominent feature of northern
India. Other developments were newer. The caste system took shape as an
institution, giving Indian society one of its most distinctive traits.
Lastly, new religious ideas were put forward that challenged the
dominance of Brahmanism.

### 3.8.1 States and Cities {.import-Header3}

The kingdom of **Magadha** became the most powerful among the sixteen
states that dominated this transitional period, but only over time. At
the outset, it was just one of eleven located up and down the Ganges
River (see Map 3.7). The rest were established in the older northwest or
central India. In general, larger kingdoms dominated the Ganges basin,
while smaller clan-based states thrived on the periphery. They all
fought with each other over land and resources, making this a time of
war and shifting alliances.

The victors were the states that could field the largest armies. To do
so, rulers had to mobilize the resources of their realms. The Magadhan
kings did this most effectively. Expansion began in 545 BCE under King
Bimbisara. His kingdom was small, but its location to the south of the
lower reaches of the Ganges River gave it access to fertile plains, iron
ore, timber, and elephants. Governing from his inland fortress at
**Rajagriha**, Bimbisara built an administration to extract these
resources and used them to form a powerful military. After concluding
marriage alliances with states to the north and west, he attacked and
defeated the kingdom of Anga to the east. His son Ajatashatru, after
killing his father, broke those alliances and waged war on the Kosala
Kingdom and the Vrijji Confederacy. Succeeding kings of this and two
more Magadhan dynasties continued to conquer neighboring states down to
321 BCE, thus forging an empire. But its reach was largely limited to
the middle and lower reaches of the Ganges River.

To the northwest, external powers gained control. As we have seen, the
mountain ranges defining that boundary contain passes permitting the
movement of peoples. This made the northwest a crossroads, and at times,
the peoples crossing through were the armies of rulers who sought to
control the riches of India. Outside powers located in Afghanistan,
Iran, or beyond might extend political control into the subcontinent,
making part of it a component in a larger empire.

One example is the Persian Empire (see Chapter 5). During the sixth
century, two kings, Cyrus the Great and Darius I, made this empire the
largest in its time. From their capitals on the Iranian Plateau, they
extended control as far as the Indus River, incorporating parts of
northwest India as provinces of the Persian Empire. Another example is
Alexander the Great (also see Chapter 5). Alexander was the king of
Macedon, a Greek state. After compelling other Greeks to follow him, he
attacked the Persian Empire, defeating it in 331 BCE. That campaign took
his forces all the way to mountain ranges bordering India. Desiring to
find the end of the known world and informed of the riches of India,
Alexander took his army through the Khyber Pass and overran a number of
small states and cities located in the Punjab. But to Alexander's
dismay, his soldiers refused to go any further, forcing him to turn
back. They were exhausted from years of campaigning far from home and
discouraged by news of powerful Indian states to the east. One of those
was the kingdom of Magadha.

Magadha's first capital---Rajagriha---is one of many cities and towns
with ruins dating back to this transitional period. Urban centers were
sparse during the Vedic Age but now blossomed, much like they did during
the mature phase of the Harappan Civilization. Similar processes were at
work. As more forests were cleared and marshes drained, the agricultural
economy of the Ganges basin produced ever more surplus food. The
population grew, enabling more people to move into towns and engage in
other occupations as craftsmen, artisans, and traders. Kings encouraged
this economic growth as its revenue enriched their treasuries. Caravans
of ox-drawn carts or boats laden with goods traveling from state to
state could expect to encounter the king's customs officials and pay
tolls. So important were rivers to accessing these trade networks that
the Magadhan kings moved their capital to **Pataliputra**, a port town
located on the Ganges (see Map 3.7). Thus, it developed as a hub of both
political power and economic exchange. Most towns and cities began as
one or the other, or as places of pilgrimage.

### 3.8.2 The Caste System {.import-Header3}

As the population of northern India rose and the landscape was dotted
with more villages, towns, and cities, society became more complex. The
social life of a Brahmin priest who served the king differed from that
of a blacksmith who belonged to a town guild, a rich businessman
residing in style in a city, a wealthy property owner, or a poor
agricultural laborer living in a village. Thus, the social identity of
each member of society differed.

In ancient India, one measure of identity and the way people imagined
their social life and how they fit together with others was the *varna*
system of four social classes. Another was **caste**. Like the *varnas*,
castes were hereditary social classifications; unlike them, they were
far more distinct social groups. The four-fold *varna* system was more
theoretical and important for establishing clearly who the powerful
spiritual and political elites in society were: the Brahmins and
Kshatriya. But others were more conscious of their caste. There were
thousands of these, and each was defined by occupation, residence,
marriage, customs, and language. In other words, because "I" was born
into such-and-such a caste, my role in society is to perform this kind
of work. "I" will be largely confined to interacting with and marrying
members of this same group. Our caste members reside in this area, speak
this language, hold these beliefs, and are governed by this assembly of
elders. "I" will also be well aware of who belongs to other castes and
whether or not "I" am of a higher or lower status in relation to them,
or more or less pure. On that basis, "I" may or may not be able, for
instance, to dine with them. That is how caste defined an individual's
life.

The lowest castes were the untouchables. These were peoples who engaged
in occupations considered highly impure, usually because they were
associated with taking life; such occupations include corpse removers,
cremators, and sweepers. So those who practiced such occupations were
despised and pushed to the margins of society. Because members of higher
castes believed touching or seeing them was polluting, untouchables were
forced to live outside villages and towns, in separate settlements.

### 3.8.3 The Challenge to Brahmanism: Buddhism {.import-Header3}

During this time of transition, some individuals became dissatisfied
with life and chose to leave the everyday world behind. Much like the
sages of the *Upanishads*, these renunciants, as they were known, were
people who chose to renounce social life and material things in order
that they might gain deeper insight into the meaning of life. Some of
them altogether rejected Brahmanism and established their own belief
systems. The most renowned example is **Siddhartha Gautama** (c.
563--480 BCE), who is otherwise known as the **Buddha**.

Buddha means "Enlightened One" or "Awakened One," implying that the
Buddha was at one time spiritually asleep but at some point woke up and
attained insight into the truth regarding the human condition. His life
story is therefore very important to Buddhists, people who follow the
teachings of the Buddha.

Siddhartha was born a prince, son to the chieftain of Shakya, a
clan-based state located at the foothills of the Himalaya in northern
India. His father wished for him to be a ruler like himself, but
Siddhartha went in a different direction. At twenty-nine, after marrying
and having a son, he left home. Legends attribute this departure to his
having encountered an old man, a sick man, a corpse, and a wandering
renunciant while out on an excursion. Aging, sickness, and death posed
the question of suffering for Siddhartha, leading him to pursue
spiritual insight. For years, he sought instruction from other wanderers
and experimented with their techniques for liberating the self from
suffering through meditation and asceticism. But he failed to obtain the
answers he sought.

Then, one day, while seated beneath a tree meditating for an extended
period of time, a deepening calm descended upon Siddhartha, and he
experienced *nirvana*. He also obtained insight into the reasons for
human suffering and what was needful to end it. This insight was at the
heart of his teachings for the remaining forty-five years of his life.
During that time, he traveled around northern India teaching his
dharma---his religious ideas and practices---and gained a following of
students.

The principal teaching of the Buddha, presented at his first sermon, is
called the **Four Noble Truths**. The first is the noble truth of
suffering. Based on his own experiences, the Buddha concluded that life
is characterized by suffering not only in an obvious physical and mental
sense but also because everything that promises pleasure and happiness
is ultimately unsatisfactory and impermanent. The second noble truth
states that the origin of suffering is an unquenchable thirst. People
are always thirsting for something more, making for a life of
restlessness with no end in sight. The third noble truth is that there
is a cure for this thirst and the suffering it brings: *nirvana.
Nirvana* means "blowing out," implying extinction of the thirst and the
end of suffering. No longer striving to quell the restlessness with
temporary enjoyments, people can awaken to "the city of nirvana, the
place of highest happiness, peaceful, lovely, without suffering, without
fear, without sickness, free from old age and
death."[^\[1\]^](#chapter-003-unknown-2.xhtml_footnote-281-1 "Rupert Gethin, The Foundations of Buddhism (Oxford University Press, 1998), 79."){#chapter-003-unknown-2.xhtml_return-footnote-281-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"} The fourth noble truth is the
Eightfold Path, a set of practices that leads the individual to this
liberating knowledge. The Buddha taught that through a program of study
of Buddhist teachings (right understanding, right attitude), moral
conduct (right speech, right action, right livelihood), and meditation
(right effort, right concentration, right mindfulness), anyone could
become a Buddha. Everyone has the potential to awaken, but each must
rely on his or her own determination.

After the Buddha died c. 480 BCE, his students established monastic
communities known as the Buddhist *sangha*. Regardless of their *varna*
or caste, both men and women could choose to leave home and enter a
monastery as a monk or nun. They would shave their heads, wear
ochre-colored robes, and vow to take refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and
*sangha*. Doing so meant following the example of the Buddha and his
teachings on morality and meditation, as well as living a simple life
with like-minded others in pursuit of *nirvana* and an end to suffering.

3.9 THE MAURYAN EMPIRE (321--184 BCE)

The kingdom of Magadha was the most powerful state in India when the
Nanda Dynasty came to power in 364 BCE. Nine Nanda kings made it even
greater by improving methods of tax collection and administration,
funding irrigation projects and canal building, and maintaining an
impressive army of infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.

But Nanda aspirations were cut short when they were overthrown by
**Chandragupta Maurya** (r. 321--297 BCE), who began a new period in
India's history. He and his son Bindusara (r. 287--273 BCE) and grandson
**Ashoka** (r. 268--232 BCE) were destined to forge the first large
empire in India's history, one that would inspire the imagination of
later empire builders in South Asia. The **Mauryan Empire** included
most of the subcontinent and lasted for 140 years (see Map 3.8).

Conflicting accounts make it difficult to say anything definitive about
the first two kings. Chandragupta may have come from a Kshatriya
(warrior) clan or a Vaishya (commoner) clan of peacock-tamers. In his
youth, he spent time in the northwest, where he encountered Alexander
the Great. With the assistance of Kautilya, a disloyal Brahmin of the
Nanda court, Chandragupta formed alliances with Nanda enemies,
overthrowing them in 321 BCE. Thereafter, through diplomacy and war, he
secured control over central and northern India.

Kautilya, whose advice may have been critical to Chandragupta's success,
is viewed as the author of the ***Arthashastra***, a treatise on
statecraft. This handbook for kings covered in detail the arts of
governing, diplomacy, and warfare. To help ensure centralization of
power in the ruler's hands, it provided a blueprint of rules and
regulations necessary to maintain an efficient bureaucracy, a detailed
penal code, and advice on how to deploy spies and informants.

Chandragupta's campaigns ended when he concluded a treaty with Seleucus
Nicator in 301 BCE. After Alexander the Great retreated from India and
then died, a struggle for his empire broke out among his generals.
Seleucus was one of them. He gained control of the eastern half and
sought to reclaim northwest India. But he was confronted by
Chandragupta, defeated, and forced to surrender the Indus Basin and much
of Afghanistan, giving the Mauryan Empire control over trade routes to
West Asia. The treaty, however, established friendly relations between
the two rulers, for in exchange for hundreds of elephants, Seleucus gave
Chandragupta a daughter in marriage and dispatched an envoy to his
court. Hellenistic kings (see Chapter 5) maintained commercial and
diplomatic ties with India.

Military expansion continued under Bindusara and Ashoka until all but
the tip of the subcontinent came under the empire's control. With King
Ashoka, however, warfare came to an end. We know far more about him
because he left behind a fascinating record telling much about his ideas
on governing. He had edicts inscribed on rocks throughout the realm and
on sandstone pillars erected in the Ganges heartland (see Map 3.9). He
then placed them in populous areas where people usually gathered so that
his officials could read them to his largely illiterate subjects.

</figure>

One rock edict speaks to why King Ashoka decided to renounce violence.
While waging war against a small state located along the east coast, he
was deeply disturbed by the amount of suffering and dislocation the war
heaped upon innocent people's lives. This realization caused him to
redouble his faith in the Buddha. Ashoka, it turns out, was a lay
follower of Buddhism.

In his edicts, he proclaimed to his subjects that the sound of the drum
would be replaced by the sound of the **dharma**. In ancient India,
dharma meant universal law. For the Brahmin priests, for example, dharma
meant a society and religious order founded on Vedic principles and the
caste system. For Buddhists, dharma consisted of the truths taught by
the Buddha. For kings, dharma was enlightened governing and just rule.
Thus, Ashoka was proclaiming that he would now rule by virtue, not
force.

Ashoka's kingly dharma was shaped by his personal practice of Buddhism.
This dharma consisted of laws of ethical behavior and right conduct
fashioned from Indian traditions of kingship and his understanding of
Buddhist principles. To gain his subjects' willing obedience, he sought
to inspire a sense of gratitude by presenting himself in the role of a
father looking out for his children. He told his subjects that he was
appointing officers to tour his realm and attend to the welfare and
happiness of all. Justice was to be impartially administered and medical
treatment provided for animals and humans. A principle of non-injury to
all beings was to be observed. Following this principle meant not only
renouncing state violence but also forbidding slaughtering certain
animals for sacrifices or for cooking in the royal kitchen. Ashoka also
proclaimed that he would replace his pleasure and hunting tours with
dharma tours. During these, he promised to give gifts to Brahmins and
the aged and to visit people in the countryside.

In return, Ashoka asked his subjects to observe certain principles. He
knew his empire was pluralistic, consisting of many peoples with
different cultures and beliefs. He believed that if he instilled certain
values in these peoples, then his realm might be knit together in peace
and harmony. Thus, in addition to non-injury, Ashoka taught forbearance.
He exhorted his subjects to respect parents, show courtesy to servants,
and, more generally, be liberal, compassionate, and truthful in their
treatment of others. These values were also to be embraced by religious
communities, since Ashoka did not want people fighting over matters of
faith.

The king's writ shaped the government. They were advised by a council of
ministers and served by high officials who oversaw the major functions
of the state. The Mauryans were particularly concerned with efficient
revenue collection and uniform administration of justice. To that end,
they divided the empire into a hierarchy of provinces and districts and
appointed officials to manage matters at each level. But given such an
immense empire spread over a geographically and ethnically diverse
territory, the level of Mauryan control varied. Historians recognize
three broad zones. The first was the metropolitan region---with its
capital Pataliputra---located on the Ganges Plain. This heartland was
tightly governed. The second zone consisted of conquered regions of
strategic and economic importance. These provinces were placed under the
control of members of the royal family and senior officials, but state
formation was slower. That is, the tentacles of bureaucracy did not
reach as deeply into local communities. Lastly, the third zone consisted
of hinterlands sparsely populated by tribes of foragers and nomads.
Here, state control was minimal, amounting to little more than
establishing workable relations with chieftains.

After King Ashoka's reign, the Mauryan Empire declined. The precise
reasons for this decline are unknown. Kings enjoyed only brief reigns
during the final fifty years of the empire's existence, so they may have
been weak. Since loyalty to the ruler was one element of the glue that
held the centralized bureaucracy together, weak kings may explain why
the political leaders of provinces pulled away and the empire fragmented
into smaller states. Furthermore, the Mauryan court's demand for revenue
sufficient to sustain the government and a large standing army may have
contributed to discontent. In 184 BCE, the last king was assassinated by
his own Brahmin military commander, and India's first major imperial
power came to an end.

## 3.10 REGIONAL STATES, TRADE, AND DEVOTIONAL RELIGION: INDIA 200 BCE--300 CE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

After the Mauryan Empire fell, no one major power held control over a
substantial part of India until the rise of the Gupta Empire in the
fourth century CE. Thus, for five hundred years, from c. 200 BCE to 300
CE, India saw a fairly rapid turnover of numerous competing regional
monarchies. Most of these were small, while the larger ones were only
loosely integrated. Some developed along the Ganges. Others were of
Central Asian origins, the product of invasions from the northwest.
Also, for the first time, states formed in southern India. Yet, in spite
of the political instability, India was economically dynamic, as trade
within and without the subcontinent flourished, and India was
increasingly linked to other parts of the world in networks of exchange.
And new trends appeared in India's major religious traditions. A
popular, devotional form of worship was added to Buddhism and also
became a defining element of Hinduism.

The general who brought the Mauryan Empire to a close by a military coup
established the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185--73 BCE). Like its predecessor,
this kingdom was centered on the middle Ganges, the heartland of India's
history since the late Vedic Age. But unlike it, the Shunga Kingdom
rapidly dwindled in size. Shunga rulers were constantly warring with
neighboring kingdoms, and the last fell to an internal coup in 73 CE.
Subsequently, during the ensuing half millennium, other regions of India
played equally prominent roles.

The northwest remained a source of dynamism, as different peoples living
beyond the Hindu Kush invaded India and established one kingdom after
another. Most of this movement was caused by instability on the steppe
lands of Central Asia, where competing confederations of nomadic
pastoralists fought for control over territory.

The most powerful among this succession of states was the **Kushan
Kingdom**, whose origins take us far away to the north of China. There,
in the second century CE, nomadic groups struggling with scarcity moved
west, displacing another group and forcing them into northern
Afghanistan. Those peoples are known as the Yuezhi (yew-eh-jer), and
they were made up of several tribes. In the first century CE, a warrior
chieftain from one Yuezhi tribe, the Kushans, united them, invaded
northwest India, and assumed exalted titles befitting a king. His
successor, ruling from Afghanistan, gained control over the Punjab and
reached into the plains of the upper Ganges River.

The greatest Kushan ruler, **King Kanishka**, furthered what these first
two kings began, forging an empire extending from Central Asia across
the mountain ranges of Afghanistan into much of northern India. Ruling
the many peoples of such a sprawling territory required more than the
periodic plundering campaigns of nomad chieftains. One sculpture of King
Kanishka puts these Central Asian roots on display (see Figure 3.7). In
it, he is wearing a belted tunic, a coat, and felt boots and carrying a
sword and mace. Kushan gold coins, however, cast him and his two
predecessors in another light: as universal monarchs (see Figure 3.8).
On one side, the crowned kings are displayed along with inscriptions
bearing titles used by the most powerful Indian, Persian, Chinese, and
Roman emperors of that time. The obverse side contains images of both
Indian and foreign deities. The Kushan rulers, it appears, solved the
problem of ruling an extensive, culturally diverse realm by patronizing
the many different gods beloved by the peoples living within it.
Buddhists, for instance, saw King Kanishka as a great Buddhist ruler,
much like they did King Ashoka. In fact, Kanishka supported Buddhist
scholarship and encouraged missionaries to take this faith from India to
Central Asia and China. But his coins also depict Greek, Persian, and
Hindu deities, suggesting that he was open-minded, and perhaps
strategic, in matters of religion.

After Kanishka's reign, from the mid-second century CE onwards, the
empire declined. Like the other larger Indian states during this time,
only a core area was ruled directly by the king's servants. The other
areas were governed indirectly by establishing tributary relations with
local rulers. As Kushan power waned, numerous smaller polities emerged,
turning northern and central India into a mosaic of states.

The Indian peninsula---the territory south of the Indo-Gangetic Plain
and the Vindhya Mountain Range---also features more prominently after
the fall of the Mauryan Empire. In the south, kingdoms emerged for the
first time. The largest was the **Satavahana** **Kingdom**, which
included most of the Deccan Plateau and lasted about three centuries.
The first rulers were former Mauryan officials who capitalized on its
dissolution, established their own state, and expanded to the north (see
Map 3.10). To establish their legitimacy, Satavahana kings embraced
Aryan civilization by allowing Brahmins to perform sacrifices at the
court and by upholding the *varna* social order. They also prospered
from a rich agricultural base and trade. However, like so many of the
larger states during these centuries, this kingdom was only loosely
integrated, consisting of small provinces governed by civil and military
officers and allied, subordinate chieftains and kings.

### 3.10.2 Economic Growth and Flourishing Trade Networks {.import-Header3}

Gold coins discovered in Kushan territory provide much information about
the rulers who issued them. The Satavahanas also minted coins.
Additionally, Roman gold coins have been found at over 130 sites in
south India. These were issued by Roman emperors at the turn of the
Christian era, during the first century CE. These coins serve as a sign
of the times. Indian monarchs issued coins because trade was growing and
intensifying all around them, and they wished to support and profit from
it. Expanding the money supply facilitated trade and was one way to
achieve that goal. Both Indian kingdoms were also geographically well
positioned to take advantage of emerging global trade networks linking
the subcontinent to other regions of Afro-Eurasia. This advantage
provides one reason why they flourished.

The expansion of trade both within and without India is a major theme of
these five centuries. Put simply, South Asia was a crossroads with much
to offer. In market towns and cities across the subcontinent, artisans
and merchants organized to produce and distribute a wide variety of
goods. **Guilds** were their principal method of organization. A guild
was a professional association made up of members with a particular
trade. Artisan guilds---such as weavers and goldsmiths---set the prices
and ensured the quality of goods. Operating like and sometimes
overlapping with castes, guilds also set rules for members and policed
their behavior. They acted collectively as proud participants of urban
communities, displaying their banners in festive processions and
donating money to religious institutions. Merchant guilds then saw to it
that their artisan products were transported along routes traversing the
subcontinent or leading beyond to foreign lands.

The lands and peoples surrounding India, and the many empires they lived
under, are the topic of later chapters, but we can take a snapshot of
the scene here (see Map 3.11). In the first century CE, India sat amidst
trade networks connecting the Roman Empire, Persian Empire (Parthian),
Chinese Empire, and a host of smaller kingdoms and states in Africa,
Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. The major trade networks were the Silk
Roads and the Indian Ocean maritime trade routes. Thus, for example,
Greco-Roman traders plied the waters of the Arabian Sea, bringing ships
filled with amphorae and gold coins to ports located along the west
coast of India and returning with spices, textiles, and gems. Indian
traders sailed the waters of the Bay of Bengal, bringing cloth and beads
from the Coromandel Coast to Southeast Asia and returning with cinnamon
cloves and sandalwood. In the northwest, a similar trade in a variety of
goods took place along the Silk Roads. Indian traders, for instance,
took advantage of the excellent position of the Kushan Empire to bring
silk from Central Asia to the ports of northwest India, from where it
could then be sent on to Rome. In sum, this vibrant international trade
constituted an early stage of globalization. Combined with regional
trade across the subcontinent, India saw an increase in travel in all
directions, even as it remained divided among many regional kingdoms.

### 3.10.3 Religious Transformations: Buddhism and Hinduism into the Common Era {.import-Header3}

Aside from expanding trade, another theme during these centuries of
political division is transformations in two of India's major religious
traditions: Buddhism and Hinduism. In both cases, new religious ideas
and practices were added that emphasized the importance of devotion and
appealed to broader groups of people.

Buddhism thrived after the Buddha died in c. 480 BCE, all the more so
during this period of regional states and the early centuries of the
Common Era, at the very moment Christianity was spreading through the
Roman Empire. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that
Buddhism was the dominant public religion. The communities of monks and
nuns (*sangha*) that formed after Buddha's time lived in monasteries
built along trade routes, near towns, or in caves. To build these and
survive, the *sangha* needed much support, which often came in the form
of royal patronage. Kings such as Ashoka and Kanishka, for example,
offered lavish support for Buddhist institutions. But over time, the
contributions of merchants, women, and people from lower *varnas* became
just as important. Unlike Vedic Brahmanism, which privileges the Brahmin
*varna*, Buddhism was more inclusive and less concerned with birth and
social class. After all, in theory, anyone could become a Buddha.

Buddhism also emphasized the importance of attaining good karma for
better rebirths and a future enlightenment; one didn't need to be a monk
to work at this. Rather, any ordinary layperson, regardless of their
religious beliefs, could also take Buddhist vows and practice Buddhist
ways. That meant not only leading a moral life but also supporting the
*sangha*. By doing so, the good karma of the monks and nuns would be
transferred to the community and oneself. This practice served not only
to make the world a better place and to ensure a better future but also
to allow opportunities for publicly displaying one's piety. That is why
kings, rich merchants, and ordinary people donated to the *sangha* and
gave monks food.

With so much support and participation, Buddhism also changed. Every
major world religion has different branches. Christianity, for example,
has three major ones: the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and
Protestant churches. These branches share a common root but diverge in
some matters of belief and practice. Buddhism has two major branches:
Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. **Theravada Buddhism** is early
Buddhism, the Buddhism of the early *sangha*, and is based on the
earliest records of the Buddha's teaching of the Four Noble Truths. A
practitioner of this form of Buddhism sought to end suffering and attain
*nirvana* by engaging the Eightfold Path, a program of study, moral
conduct, and meditation. Ideally, the practitioner pursued this program
as a monk or nun in a monastic setting and eventually became an
"arhat"---that is, a perfected person who is nearly or fully
enlightened.

**Mahayana Buddhism** came later, during the early centuries of the
Common Era. Mahayana means "Great Vehicle," pointing to the fact that
this form of Buddhism offers multiple paths to enlightenment for people
from all walks of life. This branch has no single founder and consists
of a set of ideas elaborated upon in new Buddhist scriptures dating to
this time. In one of these new paths, the Buddha becomes a god who can
be worshipped, and by anyone. A monk or lay follower is welcome to make
an offering before an image of the Buddha placed in a shrine. By doing
so, they demonstrate their desire to end suffering and seek salvation
through faith in the Buddha.

Furthermore, with the "Great Vehicle," the universe becomes populated
with numerous Buddhas. Practitioners developed the idea that if anyone
can become a Buddha over the course of many lifetimes of practice, then
other Buddhas must exist. Also, the belief arose that some individuals
had tread the path to Buddhahood but chose to forego a final
enlightenment where they would leave the world behind so that they
could, out of great compassion for all suffering people, work for their
deliverance. These holy beings are known as Bodhisattvas---that is,
enlightened persons who seek *nirvana* solely out of their desire to
benefit all humanity. Buddhists also believed that the universe
consisted of multiple worlds with multiple heavenly realms. Some of
these Buddhas and Bodhisattvas created their own heavenly realms and,
from there, offer grace to those seeking salvation through them. Through
veneration and worship, the follower hopes to be reborn in that heavenly
realm, where they can then finish the path to liberation. Seeking to
become a Bodhisattva through a path of devotion was one of the new paths
outlined by Mahayana scriptures.

Buddhism traveled out of India and had an impact on other parts of the
world, making it a major world religion. This expansion resulted from
the efforts of Buddhist missionaries and merchants, as well as kings who
supported its propagation. Theravada Buddhism was carried to Sri Lanka
and parts of Southeast Asia, where it remains a dominant religious
tradition. Mahayana Buddhism spread to Central and East Asia, a process
that was facilitated by the Silk Road and the support of kings like
Kanishka of the Kushan Empire (see Map 3.12). However, Buddhism
eventually declined in India, especially after the first millennium BCE.
From that time, Hinduism and Islam increasingly won over the religious
imagination of the peoples of India, with royal patronage and lay
support following.

Hinduism also saw new developments during this period and throughout the
first millennium CE. In fact, many scholars see these centuries as the
time during which Hinduism first took shape and prefer using the term
Vedic Brahmanism for the prior history of this religious tradition.
Vedic Brahmanism was the sacrifice-centered religion of the *Vedas*
where, in exchange for gifts, Brahmins performed rituals for kings and
householders in order to ensure the favor of the gods. It also included
the speculative world of the *Upanishads*, where renunciants went out in
search of spiritual liberation.

But something important happened during these later centuries.
Additional religious literature was compiled, and shrines and temples
with images of deities were constructed, pointing to the emergence of
new, popular forms of devotion and an effort to define a good life and
society according to the idea of **dharma**. With this transition, we
can speak more formally of Hinduism. One important set of texts is the
**Dharma Scriptures**, ethical and legal works whose authority derived
from their attribution to ancient sages. Dharma means "duty" or proper
human conduct, and so, true to their title, these scriptures define the
rules each person must follow in order to lead a righteous and devout
life and contribute to a good society. Most importantly, these rules
were determined by the role assigned to an individual by the *varna*
system of social classes, the caste system, and gender. For example, for
a male, dharma meant following the rules for their caste and *varna*
while passing through four stages in life: student, householder, hermit,
and renunciant. In his youth, a man must study to prepare for his
occupation, and as a householder, he must support his family and
contribute to society. Later in life, after achieving these goals, he
should renounce material desires and withdraw from society,
living [first]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}as a
hermit on the margins of society and then as a wandering renunciant
whose sole devotion is to god.

A woman's roles, on the other hand, were defined as obedience to her
father in youth and faithful service to her husband as an adult. For
this reason, historians see a trend in ancient Indian history whereby
women became increasingly subservient and subordinate. Although women
were to be honored and supported, the ideal society and family were
defined in patriarchal terms. That meant men dominated public life, were
the authority figures at home, and usually inherited the property. Also,
women were increasingly expected to marry at a very young age---even
prior to puberty---and to remain celibate as widows. In later centuries,
some widows even observed the practice of burning themselves upon the
funeral pyre of their deceased husband. Famous Indian epics also
illustrated the theme of duty. The ***Ramayana*** ("Rama's Journey")
tells the story of Prince Rama and his wife Sita. Rama's parents---the
king and queen---wished for him to take the throne, but a second queen
plotted against him and forced him into exile for years. Sita
accompanied him but was abducted by a demon-king, leading to a battle in
consequence. With the help of a loyal monkey god, Rama defeated the
demon, recovered his wife, and returned with her to his father's
kingdom, where they were crowned king and queen. In brief, throughout
this long story, Rama exemplified the virtues of a king, and Sita
exemplified the virtues of a daughter and wife. They both followed their
dharma.

A similar theme dominates the ***Bhagavad-Gita*** ("Song of the Lord").
This classic of Hindu scripture is included as a chapter in another
Indian epic, the *Mahabharata* (*The Great Bharata*). It tells of wars
between cousins who are fighting over the title to their kingdom's
throne. As a battle was poised to commence, one of these
cousins---Prince Arjuna---threw down his weapons and refused to fight
because he did not wish to harm his kinsmen. But Krishna, his mentor and
charioteer, delivered a speech on the nature of duty for a warrior like
himself, one that illustrated the religious basis for observing dharma.
Arjuna was thus moved to action.

Religious texts and temples also signal the rise of a powerful
devotional Hinduism centered upon a few supreme deities. Stone temples
were erected for the purpose of housing representations of a god or
goddess (see Figure 3.9). People of all classes could go to the temple
to view the deity, pray, and offer fruits and flowers. By doing so, they
showed their love for this lord and their desire to be saved by his or
her grace. The most popular deities were Shiva and Vishnu.

</figure>

Growing up, devotees of these supreme deities would hear countless myths
and legends about their origins, exploits, and powers from Brahmins at
the temples or story-tellers in their hometown. Vishnu preserves the
universe and watches over it; in times of unbridled evil, he assumes the
form of an avatar to remove evil and return the world to righteousness.
King Rama of the *Ramayana* and Krishna of the *Bhagavad-Gita* are in
fact two such incarnations of Vishnu. Shiva is both benevolent and
protective but also destroys all things. Whereas Vishnu preserves the
universe, Shiva destroys it at the end of a cycle. A third deity,
Brahma, then recreates it. Combined, this Hindu trinity---Brahma the
creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer---represent
different facets of the one divine reality behind the great cosmic
cycles and also life and death. They each have female counterparts.
Shiva's wife Parvati, for instance, is a goddess of love and devotion
(see Figure 3.10). In sum, during this period and the first millennium
CE, several elements come together to make up the religion outsiders
later labeled Hinduism. These elements include the sacrificial religion
of the Brahmins, the renunciants' spiritual pursuit of Self and divine
reality (*atman* and *brahman*), a social order shaped by the *varna*
and caste system, notions of law and duty embodied in each individual's
dharma, and devotion to supreme deities and their avatars. Hinduism
thoroughly shaped the social and spiritual life of the peoples of India
and of Indian society. Therefore, the rulers of ancient India supported
the Brahmins, built temples, upheld the *varna* system, and assumed
titles declaring their devotion to the supreme deities. Hinduism became
part of the king's dharma, and fulfilling that dharma brought the
approval of his subjects.

## 3.11 THE GUPTA EMPIRE AND INDIA'S CLASSICAL AGE (300--600 CE) {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The pattern of regional states characteristic of post-Mauryan times and
the early centuries of the Common Era will persist in India until the
sixteenth century. At any one time, India had many kings. But on
occasion, one king might forge a substantial regional power and assume
grand titles that elevated him over others. The political scene,
therefore, consisted of not only a mosaic of royal powers but also a
political hierarchy. Some rulers held power over others, making for a
pattern of paramountcy and subordination among kings and princes of many
different dynasties across the land. These paramount powers could then
take advantage of the stability they established and the wealth they
accrued to patronize the arts and promote a cultural renaissance. The
**Gupta Empire** is the pre-eminent example of such a power during the
period 300--600 CE; indeed, some historians see the time during which
they dominated northern India as a classical age.

</figure>

As is the case for so much of India's ancient political history, details
concerning Gupta rulers have been reconstructed largely from coins,
inscriptions, and seals. The dynasty begins in obscurity with two kings
of a minor state located along the Ganges River but then explodes on the
scene with the next two kings: **Chandragupta I** (c. 320--335) and his
son **Samudragupta** (c. 335--375). Through conquest and marital
alliances, Chandragupta I forged a larger empire in the old Ganges
heartland (see Map 3.13). A gold coin provides some of the evidence
detailing the Gupta Empire. This coin displays Chandragupta standing
next to a certain Queen Kumaradevi. He has taken the title "Great King
of Kings," which signifies imperial power, while she is identified as
the princess of a powerful neighboring kingdom (see Figure 3.11).

</figure>

During his forty-year reign, Samudragupta made the empire great, a feat
most forcefully evidenced by a royal eulogy inscribed on one of the old
edict pillars of King Ashoka. This eulogy, which describes Samudragupta
as "conqueror of the four corners of the earth," tells of how he subdued
dozens of kings across the subcontinent. Closer to home, along the
Ganges, many rulers were slain, and their territory was annexed, while
across northern India and to the southeast, others were "captured and
liberated." These captured and liberated kings were recognized as
"servants," which meant they could continue to rule their own lands as
subordinates, on the condition that they paid tribute and homage. Gupta
rulers thus directly administered a core territory along the Ganges
River while adopting a model of **tributary overlordship** for the rest.
The Gupta imperial court in effect presided over a society of tributary
rulers.

After Samudragupta's time, two more Gupta rulers enjoyed long reigns of
forty years, with the empire reaching a peak of power and prosperity.
But in the sixth century, decline set in. A series of weaker rulers
faced internal dissension at home and foreign invasion from abroad. A
great nomadic power known as the Huns emerged out of Central Asia and
invaded the northwest, destabilizing Gupta rule. Subordinate rulers then
began to break away, and smaller kingdoms replaced the empire. After the
sixth century, India entered a new stage in its history.

But there is more to these centuries than high politics. Again, the
Gupta era is often labeled as a classical age for India. A period in the
history of a civilization's being labeled as classical generally means
it was a time of artistic and intellectual excellence, with its having
attained standard-setting achievements in a number of fields. Classical
also suggests a certain level of maturation for a civilization. It
should be noted, however, that some scholars question the use of this
term because all ages produce great works, and sometimes choosing one
period as classical simply represents the biased judgment of a later
time.

Yet, during the Gupta era, India did produce important scientific
discoveries and works of art and literature. The exquisite sculptures of
the Buddha portraying his serene enlightenment and teaching were the
epitome of the classical achievement in art (see Figure 3.12). India
also saw an outpouring of literary masterpieces. **Kalidasa** is one of
India's greatest Sanskrit poets and playwrights. His play *The
Recognition of Shakuntala*, a world masterpiece, tells the story of a
girl who lived in a hermitage in the countryside after being abandoned
by her parents. One day, a king was out hunting and chanced upon her.
They fell in love and married. But then he hurried back to his palace,
and when she later came to him, he no longer knew her because he had
been cursed. The only solution for her dilemma was for her to present a
ring he had left her. Unfortunately, it had slipped off her finger. The
play tells of how this love story concluded, along with the involvement
of many higher powers.

In the field of medicine, **Ayurveda** matured as more complete editions
of ancient medical texts were compiled. Ayurveda (meaning "knowledge for
longevity") is India's ancient medical science. It provides a systematic
effort to explain the origins of diseases in dislocations of bodily
humors (substances) and to prescribe cures for them. India also saw
advancements in the fields of astronomy and mathematics. **Aryabhata**
(476--550 CE), for instance, was the first astronomer to propose that
the earth rotated on an axis and a scientific explanation for eclipses.
He calculated *pi* to 3.1416 and the solar year to 364.3586805 days. His
work demonstrates the contemporary use of a sophisticated system of
decimal notation, which was also an ancient Indian discovery.

## 3.12 INDIA'S EARLY MEDIEVAL AGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISLAMIC STATES IN INDIA, 600--1300 {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The history of ancient India concludes with the decline of the Gupta
Empire. The next major period, which lasts for roughly seven centuries
(c. 600--1300), is the early medieval age. During these centuries,
kingdoms in both the north and south proliferated and regularly turned
over. Therefore, at any one time, India was fragmented by numerous
regional kingdoms. As the rulers of these warred and formed alliances,
they employed the system of paramountcy and subordination begun during
the Gupta era, with some rulers being overlords and others vassals.
Also, successful rulers demonstrated their power by granting land to
officers, Brahmins, and temples. The outcome was a political pattern
labeled **Indian feudalism**.

These rulers also demonstrated their power---and enhanced it---by
patronizing Hindu institutions and developing local traditions in the
regions where their courts resided. They adopted titles showing their
devotion to the great Hindu deities, declared their intent to uphold
dharma, built fabulous Hindu temples in urban centers, and charged
Brahmins with attending to them and serving at their courts. One
outstanding example of a feudal kingdom is the **Chola Kingdom** of
southern India.

Lastly, at the end of this age, a new force appeared on the Indian
scene. Muslim Arab and Turkic rulers of West and Central Asia made
incursions into the subcontinent. Along with Arab traders arriving on
India's west coast for trade, they brought a new religion and type of
rule to the landscape of early medieval India and forged new connections
between the subcontinent and the rest of Afro-Eurasia.

### 3.12.1 Indian Feudalism {.import-Header3}

Feudalism is a term historians first used to describe the political,
social, and economic system of the European Middle Ages (see Chapter
Twelve). That system was the world of lords, vassal knights, and serfs
characteristic of Europe from the tenth to thirteenth centuries. In
exchange for homage and military service, vassals received land from
their lords. These lands became their manors, and serfs worked them. The
lords and their vassals constituted a privileged nobility, while the
serfs lived in a state of servitude.

Historians also use feudalism to describe India during the early
medieval age. But the usefulness of this term is much debated, because
conditions on the ground varied from place to place, not only in Europe
but also in India. Therefore, historians now only use the term in a
general sense while also describing specific variations. In general,
feudalism designates a political and economic scene characterized by
fragmented authority, a set of obligations between lords and vassals,
and grants of land (including those who work it) by rulers in exchange
for some kind of service.

Authority on the early medieval Indian subcontinent was indeed
fragmented, not only by the many regional kingdoms that existed at any
one time but also, more importantly, within kingdoms. Because kingdoms
incessantly warred with one another, their boundaries were fluid. Rulers
usually closely administered a core area near the capital with a civil
administration while granting feudatories on the periphery. Having
defeated the ruling lineage of a powerful neighboring state---such as a
king, prince, or chief---victorious kings might allow them to retain
noble titles and their lands, on the condition that they demonstrate
allegiance to him and even supply tribute and military service. The
overlord could then wield the title "Great King of Kings," while the
lesser rulers bore titles signifying their status as subordinate rulers
who obeyed the authority of the king.

Additionally, aside from granting these feudatories, medieval rulers
also issued land grants to important persons and institutions in their
realms, such as Brahmins, high officials, or temples. As opposed to
receiving a cash salary, these recipients were permitted to retain
revenue from villages on this land, as well as to exercise some level of
judicial authority. Brahmins were so important to kings because they
aided the king in upholding his dharma. The king's duty was to protect
the people, uphold the *varna* social order, sacrifice to the
traditional Vedic deities, and show devotion to Shiva or Vishnu. As the
religious leaders and intellectuals in the community, and the most
prestigious *varna*, Brahmins could craft genealogies proving a king's
illustrious origins in the heroic lineages of the epic stories of
ancient times, perform the sacrifices, and maintain temples. So rulers
often generously gifted land to them or to the magnificent temple
complexes rulers built.

Medieval India, then, consisted of a multitude of kingdoms, each of
which governed a part of their realms through feudal arrangements by
granting feudatories and issuing land grants to nobility or prestigious
religious and political leaders in exchange for allegiance and assisting
the ruler in demonstrating his being worthy of his sacred role. In most
instances, given that society was patriarchal, rulers were male, but in
many cases, queens inherited the throne. Rudramadevi, for instance, was
chosen by her father to accede to the throne of a kingdom in central
India, likely because he had no sons or living brothers. Inscriptions
refer to her as a king; indeed, she is said to have donned male attire
while leading soldiers into battle. She is also portrayed seated on a
lion, with a dagger and shield in hand. Thus, she was conformed to the
expected role of a warrior, male king. Clearly, preserving the dynastic
line was more important than biological sex.

### 3.12.2 The Chola Dynasty {.import-Header3}

The Chola Kingdom illustrates well the grandeur of powerful regional
states during the early medieval period. South India first came to
prominence with the rise of the Satavahana Kingdom in the Deccan Plateau
(c. the second century BCE). But even at that time, in the fertile
hinterlands and along the seaboard of the southern tip of the
subcontinent, Tamil states were forming. Tamil refers to the regional
language spoken and written by Indian peoples of the far south, as well
as to their local customs and culture. Powerful Tamil lineages divided
up Tamil land among chiefdoms, and over time, some evolved into small
but impressive kingdoms. These Tamil states also adopted elements of the
Aryan culture of the north, including the use of Sanskrit, the *varna*
social system, Vedic Brahmanism, and the Hindu cults of Shiva and
Vishnu.

The **Cholas**, for instance, date back to Satavahana times, but they
don't become significant for India's political history until the ninth
century CE, when they show up as a feudatory of a neighboring Tamil
kingdom. Beginning with King Aditya I (r. 871--907), the Cholas began a
process of expansion that would eventually make it the most powerful
kingdom of the south up until the thirteenth century (see Map 3.14). Two
of the most powerful Chola rulers were **Rajaraja** **I** (r. 985--1012)
and his son Rajendra I (1012--1044). During their reigns, most of south
India was conquered, including Sri Lanka, and a royal administration was
built. Chola kings directly administered a core area of provinces and
districts with royal officials but also granted feudatories to allegiant
chieftains and land grants to Brahmins. At the local level, these
authorities worked with village assemblies and town associations, both
of which were remarkable for the level of freedom they had to manage
local affairs.

</figure>

The Chola kings proved their greatness through not only the success of
their imperial ambitions but also the temples they built. These temples,
some of the most impressive structures in India, testify to the kings'
piety. Eulogies to Chola kings describe them not only as great warriors
and conquerors but also as protectors of the dharma, destroyers of evil,
and generous givers of gifts. Because they were built in honor of the
great Hindu deities, temples put those latter qualities on display. In
1010 CE, Rajaraja I completed the Brihadeshwara Temple in Tanjavur, the
Chola capital and ceremonial center (see Figure 3.13). Atop the main
sanctuary stands a sixty-two-meter tall tower carved out of a block of
granite weighing eighty-one tons. Numerous representations portray the
supreme lord Shiva in his various manifestations, including one located
in the inner sanctuary. On the profusely ornamented tower, Shiva appears
repeatedly in his form as destroyer of the cities of demons. Clearly,
Rajaraja I wished to raise the cult of Shiva to a pre-eminent position
in his kingdom and built this temple to project Chola power.

Like other great regional powers with their unique histories and
architectural traditions during the early medieval period, the Chola
kingdom peaked for about two centuries and then declined. In the
thirteenth century, neighboring kingdoms nibbled away at its power, and
it came to an end.

### 3.12.3 The Rise of Islamic States in North India {.import-Header3}

One of the most important developments during India's early medieval age
is the arrival of Muslim Arab and Turkic traders and conquerors and the
eventual establishment of Islamic states and communities in India. This
story begins with the life of Muhammad (570--632 CE), the Prophet of
Islam, whose revelations were recorded in the Quran (see Chapter 8).
During his lifetime and after, an Arab community and state governed by
the principles of Islam were founded in Arabia. Over the course of the
seventh and eighth centuries, this Arab Islamic state grew into an
empire that included much of West Asia and North Africa. This size meant
that many different ethnic groups---Egyptians, Persians, and Turks, for
instance---fell under its governing umbrella.

The ruler of this empire was the caliph, a man designated political
successor to Muhammad, as the leader of the Islamic community. The
caliph's government is called the caliphate. The first caliphs were
friends and relatives of Muhammad, but eventually, long-lasting
dynasties formed that made the position hereditary. The first was the
Umayyad Dynasty (661--750 CE) and the second the Abbasid Dynasty
(750--1258 CE). It was during these caliphates that Islam and Islamic
rule made their way into India.

During the Umayyad Caliphate, systematic reconnaissance of the northwest
coast of India was undertaken because conquests brought the empire just
to the west of the Indian subcontinent. When pirates plundered an Arab
vessel at the mouth of the Indus River, the caliph authorized punitive
measures, and Umayyad rulers sent an invasion force. In 711, the Sindh
(the lower Indus) was seized from a Hindu ruler and incorporated into
the Islamic Empire. An Islamic community then began to set roots in this
part of India.

The Umayyad Caliphate ruled from 661 to 750 CE. Note the inclusion of
part of northwest India, near the Indus River. The next major event
didn't transpire until the tenth century, at a time when Turkic peoples
had become important to the history of Islamic states in India. By this
time, the Abbasid Dynasty had replaced the Umayyad as the caliphs of the
Islamic Empire. One method Abbasid rulers used to govern their large
realm was to employ enslaved Turks as soldiers and administrators.
Today, the word Turkic might normally be associated with the country of
Turkey, but in fact, Turkic peoples and their language
family---Turkish---originated in Central Asia. That is where the
expanding Islamic Empire first encountered and began incorporating Turks
into their governing.

The significance of these Turkic slave soldiers for India is that the
Abbasids employed them as governors of the eastern end of their empire.
This end included parts of Afghanistan, the neighbor to northwest India.
In the tenth century, however, the caliphate was falling apart, and
Turkic military governors took advantage of this dissolution by
establishing an independent state in Afghanistan. The family that did so
was the Ghaznavids. Ruling from a fortress in Ghazna, the Ghaznavids
forged an empire that included much of Iran and northwest India (see Map
3.15).

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 620px">

<figcaption>Map 3.15 | The Ghaznavid Empire at its height | The capital

</figure>

The Ghaznavid ruler who first made forays into India was **Mahmud of**
**Ghazna** (971--1030). In some historical writing, Mahmud has been
portrayed as a brutal plunderer who descended on India seventeen times
with hordes of Turkic cavalry, shocking wealthy cities of the north with
the sword of Islam by destroying their Hindu temples and returning to
his capital with their stolen wealth.

But the reality may have been otherwise. Recent work suggests that
Mahmud was neither interested in spreading Islam nor caused massive
destruction. Rather, northwestern India had always been closely linked
to Central Asia, as well as being the location of both repeated
invasions and kingdoms that crossed over into the mountains.
Furthermore, by the tenth century, Muslim communities had already become
a part of the Indian scene, along the west coast and in this region.
Therefore, Mahmud's incursions were hardly something new. Nor were his
motives. In medieval India, kings often waged war not only for revenue
but also because such was their custom. Mahmud was likely no different.
His empire was experiencing instability; he therefore sought to prove
his mettle as a warrior ruler and to secure his legacy by using Indian
wealth to build palaces and mosques in Ghazna.

Ghaznavid control over India didn't extend much beyond the Punjab,
lasting less than two centuries. In 1186, Muhammad of Ghur---chieftain
of a minor hill state in Afghanistan that was subordinate to the
Ghaznavids---overthrew his overlords in Ghazna and proceeded to forge
his own empire. Desiring to extend it across northern India, he found
that his greatest foes were the Rajputs. The Rajputs were clans located
in northern and central India that claimed descent from renowned
Kshatriya (warrior) lineages of ancient times. While Muhammad of Ghur
was planning his military expeditions, the Rajputs were governing
several regional Hindu kingdoms from large fortresses they had built. In
1192, Muhammad's forces defeated a confederation of Rajput rulers at the
Battle of Tarain. His slave general and commander-in-chief, Qutb-ud-din
Aybak, then achieved a string of victories across northern India, making
it a part of the Ghurid Empire.

Muhammad of Ghur returned to his Afghan homeland, leaving northern India
to Aybak, who then proceeded to set up his headquarters in Delhi, one of
the most important cities in South Asia and also the capital of today's
nation of India. When Muhammad died in 1206, Aybak took control of these
Indian possessions and established a state of his own called the **Delhi
Sultanate** (see Map 3.16). A sultanate is the government of a sultan,
and a sultan is an Islamic ruler who governs a country largely
independently of the caliphs but without claiming their title. The Delhi
sultans, then, were the sovereign rulers of the first major Muslim state
in India, one that would last for three hundred years.

</figure>

Looking ahead to our own time, the nation of India today is both
culturally and religiously diverse. Approximately 80% of the population
practices Hinduism, while 15% practices Islam, making these the two
largest religious traditions in India today. For this reason, relations
between peoples adhering to these two different faiths have been an
important issue in the history of South Asia. As we have seen, the
history of Islam and Islamic communities in the subcontinent begins
during the early medieval period. Therefore, historians pay close
attention to how Delhi sultans governed an overwhelmingly Hindu
population, as well as how Islamic communities fit into it.

Ruling as they were over an ancient and vast agrarian civilization, the
Turkic sultans worked out an accommodation with India, adapting to the
pattern of Indian feudalism. Outside the highest levels of government,
Hindu society and its traditional leaders were largely left in place, so
long as tax revenue was submitted. With a long history of conquest
behind them, Islamic rulers had learned the benefits of adopting a
pragmatic approach to non-Muslims, and these sultans were no exception.
They had little interest in forcibly converting people to the faith and
rather adopted a principle from the Quran whereby non-Muslim peoples
with a scriptural tradition of their own can live amidst the Islamic
community and state so long as they pay a higher tax. At the highest
levels, however, sultans placed Turkic military nobility and educated
Persians in charge, often compensating them with land grants. In fact,
because Persians became so important to Sultanate administration,
Persian was adopted as the language of government.

This Muslim ruling elite attempted to retain their Turkic and Persian
traditions but also slowly adopted Indian customs in what was generally
a tolerant atmosphere. At the lower levels of society, Muslim traders
and artisans became an important presence in Indian towns and cities, as
did Indian converts who saw an advantage to converting to this faith.
Thus, Hindu and Muslim communities increasingly interacted with each
other during the early medieval age, adopting elements of each other's
way of life. For that reason, historians speak of a fusion of Islamic
and Indian culture.

## 3.13 CONCLUSION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

We have now passed through the long course of India's ancient and early
medieval history. We began with the onset of India's Neolithic period in
the seventh millennium BCE and saw how India's first civilization---the
Harappan Civilization (2600--1700 BCE)---emerged from it in the
northwestern region of the subcontinent during the third millennium BCE.

We then examined the long course of the Vedic Age (1700--600 BCE). As
the Harappan Civilization declined, Indo-Aryans migrated from Central
Asia into northern India, bringing with them their Vedic religion,
Sanskrit language, and pastoral and farming way of life. As they settled
down on the Indo-Gangetic Plains and interacted with indigenous peoples,
new political, social, and religious institutions formed. Over the
course of several centuries, Aryan clan and tribal organization
developed into kingdoms and oligarchies. Also, a simpler society
composed of priests, warriors, and commoners evolved into a more complex
society organized by *varnas*, the system of four hereditary social
classes. Finally, the Vedic religion of the Brahmin priests evolved into
Brahmanism, the earliest stage in the development of Hinduism.

Next, we surveyed a transitional period in India's history that began in
the sixth century and lasted until 321 BCE. Sixteen major kingdoms and
oligarchies with roots in the late Vedic Age fought for control over
territory in northern India. The kingdom of Magadha dominated.
Accompanying this time of warring states, India entered a second stage
of urbanization, as towns and cities became a prominent feature of the
north. Alongside the *varnas*, the caste system began to form,
organizing Indian society into a much larger number of social groups
based on occupation, residence, language, and religious beliefs. Lastly,
new religious ideas were put forward by the Buddha (c. 563--480 BCE) to
challenge the dominance of Brahmanism, and Buddhist monastic communities
began to form.

This transitional period ended when Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the
last Magadhan dynasty in 321 BCE and established the Mauryan Empire
(321--184 BCE). He and his successors built the first Indian state that
included most of the subcontinent. Chandragupta's grandson, King Ashoka
(r. 268--232), is famed for having tried to rule this large realm
according to Buddhist principles.

We then saw how, for five centuries after the fall of the Mauryan Empire
(c. 200 BCE--300 CE), no one major power ruled India. The entire
subcontinent saw instead a fairly rapid turnover of regional monarchies.
Some developed along the Ganges River, while others, such as the Kushan
Kingdom, were of Central Asian origins. Also, states such as the
Satavahana Kingdom formed in southern India. Yet, in spite of the
political instability, India was economically dynamic, as trade within
and without the subcontinent flourished, and India was increasingly
linked to other parts of the world in such networks of exchange as the
Silk Road and Indian Ocean maritime trade. Lastly, new trends appeared
in Buddhism and Hinduism, most notably a popular, devotional form of
worship.

Although India remained a mosaic of states during the period 300--600
BCE, historians recognize this time as distinct because the Gupta Empire
(320--550 CE) included much of northern India, and facets of Gupta
period society and culture suggest that Indian civilization had matured
and entered a classical age. One facet was individual achievements in
literature, the arts, and sciences. But equally as important, the lives
of all members of society were now being shaped and given meaning by a
political pattern, social institutions, religious traditions, and a
culture with a deep history. That political pattern included, for
example, notions of kingship and the king's dharma, as well as political
hierarchy. Social institutions included the patriarchal family, *varna*
and caste, and commercial associations in cities and towns. As for
religious traditions, we have focused on the development of Hinduism and
Buddhism and how they shaped the religious landscape with their long
literary and scriptural traditions, notions of dharma, and monastic and
temple life.

We ended this chapter by introducing early medieval India (c. 600--1300
BCE). The political scene remained one of powerful regional states, each
with their unique local histories and traditions. The methods by which
kings established relations with neighboring rulers and within their own
lands has been described as Indian feudalism. Some kings, like the
Cholas, buttressed their power by claiming to rule according to Hindu
notions of dharma, by, for instance, building large Hindu temples and
patronizing the Brahmins. Finally, during these centuries, Islamic rule,
communities, and religion entered the South Asian landscape, changing
the course of India's history.

In 1974, farmers digging a well in a field located in northwest China
uncovered fragments of a clay figurine. Little did they know, they had
chanced upon what turned out to be one of the most fascinating
archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century. Subsequent
excavation revealed that beneath the fragment lay a massive underground
pit filled with over seven thousand terracotta figurines modeling
archers, infantrymen, and charioteers. Another pit contained terracotta
cavalry and infantry units that composed a military guard, while a third
one contained high-ranking officers and war chariots in what was perhaps
a command post. These three pits are part of a much larger complex of
underground vaults spread across twenty-two square miles. Most
importantly, a large, forested burial mound towers over the neighboring
fields containing these underground armies. This is where the First
Emperor of Qin \[cheen\] was buried after he died in 210 BCE. Although
it hasn't yet been excavated, experts believe the tomb is a microcosm of
the emperor's palace, capital city, and empire. The pits, then,
contained the army protecting his realm in the afterlife. With this
discovery, our understanding of how China was unified under one empire
after a long period of warfare was advanced immeasurably.

**East Asia** can be defined in two different ways. Geographically
speaking, it can be defined as the eastern region of the Asian continent
and the countries located there, principally China, North and South
Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. But historians also define East Asia as a
broader cultural realm and include countries that both shared close
historical relations with China and were impacted by China's political
and legal institutions and Confucian and Buddhist traditions. When
defined in this way, Vietnam is also included. This chapter, however, as
an introduction to the early history of East Asia, will focus on China,
Korea, and Japan.

## 4.5 GEOGRAPHY OF EAST ASIA

China's early historical development long predated Japan's and Korea's,
which is why a chapter on East Asian history logically begins in the
second millennium BCE with China's first dynasty. However, today's
nation of China is much larger than China was in ancient times. In
earlier times, the bulk of the Chinese population lived in **China
proper**, by which we mean the historical heartland of ancient China
(see Map 4.1). To the east, China proper is bounded by the Yellow Sea,
East China Sea, and South China Sea. To the south, it is bordered by the
mountainous jungles of Southeast Asia. To the west and north, China is
rimmed by a transitional frontier zone where land suited to agriculture
gives way to mountains and plateaus or vast expanses of steppe
grasslands and desert. At times, the dynasties of China became actively
involved in all of these neighboring areas, incorporating them directly
into their expanding empires or indirectly as subordinate,
tribute-paying states. Those areas include parts of the Korean
Peninsula, Northeast China, Mongolia, Central Asia, and Vietnam. Within
China proper, two rivers were particularly important to the formation of
agricultural communities that served as the building blocks of Chinese
civilization. Those were the **Yellow River** and **Yangzi River**. The
**Yellow River** meanders through the northern half of China, where a
cool, dry climate is well-suited to wheat and millet farming. Beginning
far to the west, this river meanders over a dusty plateau, becomes
muddied with silt, and then deposits this sediment along its middle and
lower reaches. The plains surrounding these reaches are collectively
referred to as the **North China Plain**. Historically, this was the
heartland of Chinese civilization. However, the **Yangzi** **River** was
just as important. Located in south China where the weather is
relatively warmer and wetter, its long basin provided fertile soil for
rice-paddy agriculture. Over time, the early dynasties expanded into and
included the settled agricultural communities in this region.

Japan is an island country consisting of four main islands and many
smaller ones located off the Pacific coast of the Asian continent. At
400,000 square kilometers, Japan is slightly smaller than California,
although the terrain is more rugged. Because Japan is covered by
mountains and traversed by numerous rivers, only fifteen percent of the
land is suited to agriculture. Much of that was concentrated in two
plains---the Kinai Plain and Kanto Plain---making them particularly
important to Japan's early history. Japan is also located along the
Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates composing the earth's crust
frequently move and collide. That is why earthquakes and volcanic
activity have been a constant threat to populations living on these
islands.

The **Korean Peninsula** is the location of North and South Korea today.
Prior to the twentieth century, however, it saw a long succession of
Korean kingdoms. Extending roughly 1100 kilometers southward from the
Asian landmass, the peninsula is bounded by seas to the east, west, and
south and defined by the Yalu River to the north. Beyond that lies
Northeast China, which was only periodically included in the territory
of Chinese empires. Consequently, because the peninsula lies between
China to the north and west and Japan to the east, Korean dynasties have
been deeply impacted by these states' histories and cultures. Like
Japan, Korea is also mountainous, although coastal areas and plains
located to the west and south were well-suited to agriculture.

The countries of East Asia share in the region's temperate climate and
summer monsoon season. During the summer months, warm and moist air
originating from the Pacific flows from southeast to northwest, while
during the winter months, cold and dry air originating from Central Asia
moves in the opposite direction. Thus, those areas of East Asia located
further to the east and south are generally warmer and wetter, and for
longer periods of time. That made them well-suited to rice-paddy
agriculture, and rice consequently became the primary cereal crop in
southern China, the Korean Peninsula, and the islands of Japan. While
growing rice is labor intensive, this grain also offers high yields per
unit of land, so it has supported population growth in these countries
and, therefore, the formation of vibrant civilizations.

## 4.6 CHINA FROM NEOLITHIC VILLAGE SETTLEMENTS TO THE SHANG KINGDOM

Chapters Two and Three covered the development of the first major
civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and India. In each case, rivers
were particularly important to that process because they offered a
stable supply of water for agriculture. Similarly, in China, the first
major states emerged along China's second longest river---the **Yellow
River**. These states are the **Xia** \[shee-ah\] **Dynasty** (c.
1900--1600 BCE), **Shang** \[shawng\] **Dynasty** (1600--1046 BCE), and
**Zhou** \[joe\] **Dynasty** (1045--256 BCE). Each of these kingdoms was
ruled by a line of hereditary monarchs hailing from one lineage, which
is why they are also referred to as dynasties.

Because written sources don't become available until the Shang Dynasty,
historians have relied heavily on the archaeological record to
reconstruct the process by which these states arose. Looking back at the
end of the Paleolithic era (c. 10,000 BCE), East Asia was sparsely
populated by bands of foragers living in temporary settlements. During
the eighth millennium BCE, in China, some of these hunter-gatherers
turned to domesticated cereals for a stable food supply and settled into
villages so they could cultivate them. Thus, the Neolithic Age
(8000--2000 BCE) commenced.

</figure>

Over the course of those six millennia leading up to the Xia Dynasty,
Neolithic communities became more diverse and complex. For instance, for
the period 5000--3000 BCE, archaeologists have identified at least eight
major regional Neolithic cultures located along rivers and coasts (see
Map 4.2). They did so by examining pottery styles and village settlement
patterns. One example is **Yangshao** **culture**, which was
concentrated along the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Over one
thousand sites left behind by millet-farming village communities have
been discovered. Jiangzhai (c. 4000 BCE), for instance, was a moated
village settlement that occupied roughly thirteen acres (see Figure
4.2). It was composed of related lineages and tribal in organization.

During the third millennium BCE, Yangshao culture was gradually
supplanted by **Longshan culture** (c. 3000--1900 BCE), which emerged
further to the east, along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow
River. In 1928, when archaeologists excavated a site near the town after
which Longshan was named, they found evidence for a culture that had
laid the foundations for the kingdoms that emerged in the second
millennium BCE, including the ruins of numerous walled towns with
cemeteries outside (see Map 4.3). Their rammed-earth walls protected
urban areas with public buildings, roads, and drainage systems. The
cemetery's arrangement suggests that people living in the towns were
buried alongside clan members but also that some members were wealthier
and more powerful: while most graves had nothing but a skeleton, others
contained numerous artifacts, such as pottery and jade.

Based on this evidence, archaeologists have concluded that during the
third millennium BCE, the population grew, and some of it shifted from
villages to walled towns. These walled towns developed into political
and economic centers exercising control over and serving as protection
for surrounding communities. Individuals with more elaborate graves were
likely political and religious leaders and served as chieftains. Hence,
numerous competing chiefdoms emerged, providing the foundation for more
powerful kingdoms to follow.

Ancient Chinese histories identify the first major kingdom as the **Xia
Dynasty** (c. 1900--1600 BCE). However, these were written many
centuries after the kingdom about which they speak, and lacking written
evidence from the dynasty itself, specialists have been unable to
definitively establish its location. Nevertheless, most agree that the
Xia capital was located along the Yellow River at Erlitou
\[are-lee-toe\] (see Map 4.3). At its peak of activity from 1900 to 1600
BCE, this town looks like something more complex than a chiefdom.
Erlitou included a central, walled palace complex (see Figure 4.3),
workshops for the production of bronze and pottery, and elite burials
containing bronze weapons and jade, suggesting a socially stratified,
Bronze Age civilization and kingdom. Many historians identify it as the
capital of the Xia Dynasty.

With the **Shang Dynasty** (1600--1046 BCE), we formally enter China's
historical period. In 1899, in an apothecary, a Chinese scholar came
across mysterious bones that were being ground up for use as medicine.
He immediately recognized that the Chinese characters inscribed on them
were very ancient. Subsequently, the origin of these bones was traced to
fields in **Anyang** \[anneyawng\], China, where, beginning in 1928,
excavations were carried out. Similar to the discovery of the Indus
Valley Civilization, a lost civilization was revealed on the North China
Plain, the one difference being that traditional histories of a later
time had documented this one (see Map 4.4).

The findings were substantial. A diverse array of settlements with a
royal capital at the center covered nearly thirty square kilometers (see
Map 4.5). Archaeologists have identified 53 pounded earth foundations as
the floors of royal palace-temples and the ruins in their vicinity as
residential areas for elites and commoners; sacrificial pits; and
workshops for the production of bronze, pottery, and stone. Also, a
royal cemetery with eight large tombs and dozens of smaller ones lies to
the northwest. The larger graves were roughly half the size of a
football field, each accessible through four ramps whose orientation to
the cardinal directions gives them the appearance of crosses. Deep down
at the bottom of each tomb's central shaft, wooden chambers were built
to house the dead bodies of Shang kings. Shockingly to us, dozens of
human skeletons were placed above and below these, presumably as
servants to accompany rulers in the afterlife.

**Anyang**, we now know, served as the last capital of the Shang
Dynasty, from 1200 to 1046 BCE. It was at the center of a loosely
governed territorial state located on the North China Plain. Shang kings
directly governed the capital and its vicinity but likely controlled
areas farther out by building confederations with locally powerful
lineage chieftains and regularly hunting, warring, and carrying out
rituals with them. Some of those leaders were directly related to the
Shang kings, and some were allies by marriage.

The bones are the most important source for understanding this kingdom.
Most of the two hundred thousand fragments found so far are either
turtle plastrons or scapula from cows. Interestingly, these were used
for divination, which is why they are called **oracle bones** (see
Figure 4.5). When a Shang king or his diviners sought to know the
future, they would proceed to a temple erected in honor of a Shang deity
or the spirits of deceased ancestors in the royal line. Before a stone
tablet, they would make a statement about what might happen (for
example, "It will rain") and then apply heat to a hole bored into a bone
until it cracked. The crack was viewed as the response from the god or
spirit. The king would then determine whether or not it was auspicious,
and a record would be inscribed on the bone, sometimes including the
actual outcome (see Figure 4.6). From these, we know that Shang elites
believed that the high god Di, nature gods, and the spirits of deceased
kings controlled the future. That is why Shang kings had massive bronzes
cast and carried out sacrifices for them. The bronzes were filled with
food and placed at the temples, literally to feed the spirits. Likewise,
the sacrificial pits show that a substantial shedding of blood for these
higher powers was a regular occurrence. Shang elites worshipped their
ancestors and frequently divined to determine their will.

## 4.7 THE LONG ZHOU DYNASTY (1046--256 BCE)

After the Xia and Shang, the next major dynasty in Chinese history is
the **Zhou Dynasty** (1045--256 BCE). In 1046 BCE, a Zhou king overthrew
the last Shang ruler and established control over much of north China.
In the early centuries of Zhou rule, during the **Western Zhou**
(1046--771 BCE), Zhou kings dispatched kinsmen to territories the kings
granted to them (see Map 4.5). These nobles were allowed to rule their
own lands hereditarily, so long as they observed certain obligations to
their king.

</figure>

But over time, Zhou kings lost their ability to control these lords, and
the lords became increasingly independent. In 771 BCE, in what became a
telling sign of weakness, the Zhou king was murdered, and his young
successor was compelled to relocate farther east, to a capital closer to
the heart of the North China Plain. This move marked the beginning of
the Eastern Zhou (770--256 BCE). Over the long course of this half
millennium, Zhou nobility engaged in escalating warfare with each other
over matters small and large. As they did so, their lands evolved into
powerful states (see Map 4.7). Eventually, the noble lords of the most
powerful states also declared themselves kings and fought to gain
control over all of China. During the third century BCE, the Zhou
Kingdom was destroyed, and one of these warring states, the **Qin**
\[Cheen\] **Dynasty**, prevailed over the rest.

But these centuries were not only marked by the growth of states and
accelerating warfare between them. Burgeoning turmoil also inspired much
thinking about what was needful to restore order and create a good
society, as well as what defined the good life. Two major philosophical
traditions emerged to address these issues: **Confucianism** and
**Daoism**.

### 4.7.1 The Western Zhou Dynasty (1046--771 BCE)

In the eleventh century BCE, the Zhou state was a minor power on the
western periphery of the Shang realm, located along the Wei \[way\]
River. In 1059, upon witnessing five planets align, the Zhou ruler
declared himself king and proceeded to engage in military conquests that
made his kingdom a regional power to be reckoned with. This was King Wen
("Cultured King"), a ruler revered as the founder of the Zhou Dynasty.
But it was his son **King Wu** ("Martial King") who brought down the
Shang Dynasty. He assumed the throne upon his father's death and, in
1046, led three hundred chariots and 45,000 foot soldiers equipped with
bronze armor and pole-mounted dagger-axes to a location just outside the
Shang capital, where he met with and decisively defeated the last Shang
king and his army.

King Wu then returned to his capital in the Wei River Valley, where he
passed away in 1043 BCE. His young son took the throne but was placed
under the regency of Wu's capable brother, the Duke of Zhou. Now, the
Zhou royal court was faced with the task of governing newly conquered
territory, including the former lands of the Shang Dynasty. The king and
his regent did so by implementing three policies. First, they
established a secondary capital farther east at Luoyang \[low-yawng\],
closer to the North China Plain. Second, they issued proclamations
explaining to conquered peoples why they should accept Zhou rule.
According to the Duke of Zhou, Heaven had decreed that Shang kings must
fall and Zhou rulers should replace them. The Shang Dynasty had begun
with wise and benevolent rulers, but later kings were cruel and
incompetent and failed to see to the well-being of their subjects. Thus,
a dynasty once sanctioned by Heaven had lost this sanction; now, Heaven
had called upon Zhou rulers to overthrow the Shang Dynasty and initiate
a new era of just rule. This political theory, which is known as the
**Mandate of Heaven**, would also be used by founders of later dynasties
to justify their actions, as well as by theorists to explain the rise
and fall of dynasties. The third policy the Zhou court adopted was to
dispatch royal kinsmen to strategically critical locations for the
purpose of establishing colonies. At their royal palaces, Zhou kings
conducted ceremonies of investiture during which they sacrificed to
Heaven and the spirits of deceased ancestors, held banquets, and then
bestowed noble titles and grants of land upon members of the royal
family and relatives by marriage. Large bronzes were cast to commemorate
these occasions (see Figure 4.7). These lords---dukes, marquis, earls,
and barons---then took their families, contingents of soldiers, and
emblems of nobility to the granted territory and set up palaces and
ancestral temples in walled towns. From there, these illustrious
lineages governed a predominantly rural population of farmers living in
villages where life was not easy. Living in hovels and with little
opportunity to leave their lord's manors, these farmers were required to
work his lands and also to submit a portion of the harvest from their
own small farms.

</figure>

Historians call this method of governing **Zhou kinship feudalism**.
Feudalism generally describes a political and economic system
characterized by fragmented authority, a set of obligations (usually of
a military nature) between lords and vassals, and grants of land
("fiefs") by rulers in exchange for some type of service (see Chapters
Three and Twelve). Indeed, Zhou kings granted land and noble titles to
kinsmen in exchange for obedience, periodic visits to the king's palace,
tribute, and military support. However, aside from the presence of royal
overseers, a hereditary lord enjoyed relative sovereignty in his own
domain. The glue that held the Zhou feudal order together was deference
to the king and his Mandate and reverence for their shared
history---including, most importantly, the deceased spirits of their
related ancestors.

Over time, however, Zhou kinship feudalism failed to function as
intended by the founding rulers. In brief, Zhou kings' ability to
control the noble lords diminished over time, and their prestige
suffered accordingly. There were two principal reasons for this. First,
ties of kinship so crucial to the founding of Zhou lost their meaning
over time. In later generations, lords simply became more interested in
and identified with their own territories, and they had little sense of
solidarity with what were at best distant cousins ruling neighboring
feudal states. Hence, it is hardly surprising that histories inform us
that the many lords ceased to pay visits to the king's court. Second,
Zhou kings were unable to impose their will on feuding feudal lords and
were even defeated by them in several military campaigns. In 771 BCE,
for instance, King You \[yo\] was attacked by the allied forces of the
lord of Shen and tribal peoples residing out west. The capital was
sacked, and he was killed. Other states came to the rescue, relocating
the king's son, Prince Ping, to the eastern capital at Luoyang. Zhou
kings remained there for the next five hundred years, during the period
called the Eastern Zhou.

### 4.7.2 The Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770--256 BCE) and the Warring States Period (c. 475--221 BCE)

When King Ping was relocated to Luoyang, he ruled from a much smaller
royal domain surrounded by approximately 150 feudal states and their
lords. His and his successors' power was, however, much reduced. No
longer able to impose their will on unruly noble lineages, Zhou kings
failed to maintain a semblance of peace and order throughout the realm.
Instead, this warrior nobility engaged in an escalating contest for
power and prestige. By 475 BCE, in the wake of 540 wars fought over the
course of two centuries, only fifteen states remained (see Map 4.6). But
they fought even more fiercely. Over the next 250 years, during what is
referred to as the **Warring States Period** (475--221 BCE), these
states averaged one major battle per year until, at the very end, only
one remained standing. That was the state of **Qin** \[cheen\]. The
Warring States Period ended in 221 BCE when the Qin ruler defeated the
remaining states and unified the former Zhou realm, initiating a new
period in China's history. The line of Zhou kings had, however, already
been extinguished in 256 BCE, so that date marks the end of the Eastern
Zhou Dynasty.

As the frequency and scale of warfare escalated, and states gradually
gobbled each other up, the way feudal lords governed their states and
conducted military campaigns changed. Prior to the Warring States
Period, Zhou kings were still accorded a level of respect, at least as
symbols of unity and nominal heads of the Zhou feudal order. At this
point, the many lords had no intention of toppling the king; rather,
seeing his military weakness, the most powerful ones stepped in to
enforce order. The first was Duke Huan of Qi \[who-an of chee\]. He held
this title ("duke") and fief (Qi) because his distant ancestor had
served as a commander under King Wu during the Zhou founding. Now, many
generations later, his state was a formidable power on the east coast.
In 651 BCE, he convened an interstate meeting with other lords to
discuss matters of order and security. Upon being elected as their
leader, the Zhou king conferred the title of **hegemon**. In this
capacity, Duke Huan had the authority to resolve disputes between nobles
on behalf of the king.

Over the next two centuries, this title changed hands several times,
going to the lord of the most powerful state. These hegemons
periodically convened interstate meetings to manage such matters as
misbehaving states or foreign invasions. Attending lords cemented their
agreements by swearing oaths and drinking the blood of sacrificed
animals. Yet, although hegemons maintained a semblance of order, warfare
remained constant because it was a way of life for the illustrious
lineages of the Zhou realm. Noble lords loved to demonstrate their
prowess and raise their prestige through success in hunting and
battling. A noble looked for a pretext to engage in a vendetta with
another lord, at which point a battle was arranged and then carried out
according to the protocols of chivalry. After announcing the impending
campaign at the ancestral temple, a lord and his kinsmen, accompanied by
farmer foot soldiers, would proceed in their chariots to a prearranged
location and engage in a skirmish. In victory, a noble redressed matters
of honor and brought glory to his ancestors, something symbolized by the
mound of dead enemies placed by his ancestral temple.

However, with the onset of the Warring States Period in the fifth
century BCE, the level of violence was no longer contained by the
hegemon system and codes of chivalry. Both the purpose and conduct of
warfare changed. Lords of the seven most powerful states lost respect
for the Zhou kings and even assumed the same title, thus claiming the
right to unify all of China under their rule. As opposed to serving a
lesson to and resolving some dispute with another lord, these
self-declared kings waged war to destroy them and take their land.

Hence, battles became increasingly bloody and bitter, and victory went
to those kings who could field the most effective killing machines.
Chariot-riding kinsmen and a few thousand foot soldiers no longer met
that requirement. During the Warring States, rulers introduced large
armies composed of mass infantry and cavalry. Soldiers were equipped
with armor, crossbows, halberds, dagger-axes, and swords manufactured
from bronze, iron, leather, and wood in royal workshops located at
capital cities ([view the
image](http://brandonqindynasty.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/3/9/10391259/8580061.jpeg)
of a Warring States Period soldier). One description of an elite soldier
states that he wears heavy armor, shoulders a large crossbow and fifty
arrows, straps a halberd to his back, buckles a helmet to his head, and
places a sword to his side. Kings also militarized their kingdoms'
landscapes by building forts at strategically critical passes, walls to
mark off boundaries, and watch towers to signal the enemy's approach.
Finally, these rulers no longer relied solely on close kinsmen to wage
war alongside them. Rather, they created a class of military commanders
and specialists whose promotion was based on their ability to produce
victories in the field. It is therefore not surprising that during this
time some of China's greatest military treatises were written, most
notably the ***Art of War*** by Master Sun \[sue-in\]. Master Sun was a
military commander and strategist who served the lords of the state of
Wu just prior to the onset of the Warring States Period (c. fifth
century BCE). The manual of military strategy and tactics attributed to
him stresses the importance of formulating a strategy that ensures
victory prior to any campaigning. Stratagem is critical. "All warfare is
deception," Master Sun states. "Hence, when able to attack, we must seem
unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near,
we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must
make him believe we are near."

To mobilize large numbers of men for war and supply them with weapons
and grain, kings devised ways to make their realms more productive and
compliant with their will. Prior to the Warring States Period, it was
the norm for nobility to hand out land in their states to kinsmen, just
as it had been for the king during the Western Zhou. This practice meant
that lesser but related aristocratic lineages lived in estates across
each noble's territory while also serving as ministers at his court. For
a king, however, these men might become an obstacle or pose a threat
because they held this land hereditarily. Therefore, they devised better
ways to control land in their realms. Whenever new territory was added
or a noble line was extinguished, kings created counties and appointed
magistrates to manage the villages and towns in that area. The
magistrate's job would then be to register the population, maintain law
and order, collect tax revenue, and conscript people for labor projects
and military campaigns. And rather than give those posts to kinsmen,
kings appointed men from the lower ranks of the nobility or commoners
based on their loyalty and merit. Stated more simply, Warring States
Period rulers created administrative units and a civil service. Their
embryonic bureaucracies included such features as a system of official
posts, salaries paid in grain and gifts, administrative codes, and
methods for measuring a servant's performance. Thus, by the end of this
period, largely owing to the demands of warfare, the Zhou feudal order
had been supplanted by a small number of powerful territorial states
with centralized monarchies. Among them, the most successful was the
state of **Qin**, which eventually conquered all of China and became an
empire. We return to that topic after reviewing the ideas put forward by
philosophers in the context of these centuries of turmoil.

### 4.7.3 Philosophy in a Time of Turmoil: Confucianism and Daoism

China's three major pre-modern philosophical and religious traditions
are Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. The first two had their origins
in the later centuries of the Eastern Zhou, while Buddhism only began to
arrive from South Asia in the first century CE. Confucianism and Daoism
were both responses to the crisis presented by the breakdown of the Zhou
feudal order and escalating warfare in China.

#### 4.7.3.1 Confucius and Confucianism

**Confucius** lived just prior to the Warring States Period (551--479
BCE). What little we know about his life comes primarily from the
*Analects*, a record of conversations Confucius held with his students
compiled after he died. In later centuries, in China, Confucius was
revered as a sage and teacher, and even today, outside of China, some
people might think of him as a stern pedant, perhaps calling to mind
sayings beginning with "The Master said." However, in the context of his
time, Confucius was anything but stiff and rather a dynamic individual
who believed he was mandated by Heaven to return the world to a more
socially and politically harmonious time. The *Analects* shows not only
a serious and learned man but also someone capable in archery and
horsemanship, who loved music and ritual, and who untiringly traveled
the feudal states in the hopes of serving in a lord's retinue (see
Figure 4.8). According to one passage, a lord once asked one of
Confucius's students about his master, but the student fell silent.
Later, Confucius asked him, "Why did you not say: As a man, when
agitated in thought he forgets to eat, joyfully forgetting his cares,
not realizing that old age is near at hand?"

Confucius was born to a family of minor nobility and modest means in the
feudal state of Lu. His father died about the time Confucius was born,
and he was raised by his mother, who also passed away when Confucius was
young. Like other young men of similar background, he had access to an
education and could aspire to serve in some capacity in a feudal state,
perhaps at the lord's court, or as an official or soldier. Confucius
chose to become learned and seek office. To his mind, he was living at a
time when civilization was collapsing and society was decaying. He
believed that during the early Zhou, the nobility was honorable,
observed moral codes, and upheld social standards. He believed that a
golden age existed in the past and wished to transmit the ethical values
of that time. However, in the course of doing so, he reinterpreted the
past and imbued the virtues he stressed with rich, new meanings. Here
are a few of the important statements Confucius made and what they
meant:

"The noble person is concerned with rightness, the small person is
concerned with profit." (4.16) Confucius redefined the meaning of
nobility. For him, nobility was defined not by birth but rather by
character and conduct. A truly noble person is one who puts what is
right before personal gain and the desire for wealth and fame.

"Young men should be filial at home and respectful to their elders when
away from home." (1.6) Filial piety is central to Confucius's thought.
He taught how a person becomes moral because a good society only
develops when composed of and led by virtuous people. He saw the
practice of morality in the family as the root. Should a young man learn
to be respectful and reverent towards parents and elders, he will become
a humane person, and humane people are far more likely to contribute in
a positive way to society.

"The noble man does not abandon humaneness for so much as the space of a
meal." (4.5) For Confucius, the highest virtue is humanity, and many of
his conversations center upon defining what it is that makes a person
humane. A person of humanity is, for instance, one who is capable of
empathy and unselfish concern for the welfare of others. They know the
golden rule: "what you would not want for yourself," he taught, "do not
do to others." (15.23) Confucius emphasized that a society cannot
function if people are incapable of taking other's perspectives and
doing their best for them. In addition, he insisted that such virtues as
humanity are most fully demonstrated when individuals observe good
etiquette. Decorum was important to Confucius.

"Heaven has given birth to the virtue that is in me."
[^\[1\]^](#chapter-004-chapter-4-china-and-east-asia-to-the-ming-dynasty.xhtml_footnote-329-1 "These selections from the Analects are translated in De Bary and Bloom, ed., Sources of Chinese Tradition, Vol. 1: From Earliest Times to the Present, 44-63."){#chapter-004-chapter-4-china-and-east-asia-to-the-ming-dynasty.xhtml_return-footnote-329-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"} (7.22) Interpreters of Confucius have
rightly noted that he is quite silent about the supernatural and what
happens after death, rather emphasizing the life we have and serving
others. Yet, it would be wrong to conclude that he wasn't religious in
any sense, because he frequently spoke of Heaven. He believed that
Heaven ordains a certain course of life for each individual, including
becoming a moral person. This Heaven, however, is less a deity than a
higher moral order, a kind of beneficent presence.

"To govern is to rectify. If you lead the people by being rectified
yourself, who will dare not be rectified?" (12.17) Confucius believed
that good governing flows from good men. The first qualification for a
ruler or one who serves is moral rectitude. If those who lead do so by
virtue and conduct themselves according to rules of propriety, people
will learn from them and develop a sense of honor and shame.
Consequently, society will become more orderly.

The noble person, filial piety, humaneness, etiquette, Heaven, and
government by men of virtue are just some of the ideas Confucius
discussed as he traveled the feudal states seeking to advise their
lords. However, he only managed to hold some minor offices in Lu and
generally failed in his political aspirations. Instead, he gained an
avid following of 70 students, whom he accepted regardless of their
social status. After he died, they passed on his teachings, and a school
of thought emerged from his teachings known as Confucianism. Those who
belong to it are **Confucians**---individuals distinguished by their
commitment to the ideas articulated by Confucius, classical learning,
and the value they place on character and conduct as the key to a good
society and political order.

#### 4.7.3.2 Philosophical and Institutional Daoism

During the turmoil of the Warring States Period, however, other
individuals developed a philosophy very different from Confucianism
called **Daoism**. These Daoists largely rejected Confucian ideas about
human moral development and social order as artificial constructs.
Rather, they pointed to a natural condition that both individuals and
society can recover, one that existed before desires trapped people in a
world of strife. Their central concept is the Dao ("Way"). The Dao is
mysterious: it is beyond sense perception and yet the source of life and
the universe, the ultimate truth transcending the polarities that make
up life and yet pervades them, empty and yet the mother of all things.

Paradoxically, although the Dao is indescribable and can't be seen or
heard, the goal of the Daoist is to accord with and follow it. But this
goal won't be accomplished through more seeking and more knowledge.
Rather, the mind must be emptied out, calmed, and purified, until
desires are absent and a primordial, natural condition is restored. At
that point, when the individual is in accord with the ineffable Way,
life becomes spontaneous, natural, and effortless. The two most
important early books belonging to this tradition are named after their
putative authors: the *Laozi* ("Old Master") and *Zhuangzi* ("Master
Zhuang")*.* Historians believe the "Old Master" was a fictional sage
invented by Warring States Period philosophers who compiled the book
attributed to him. Master Zhuang, however, lived during the fourth
century BCE.

</figure>

In later centuries, the Daoism of these early philosophers was taken in
new directions. The definition of the Way was broadened to include the
idea that individuals have a spiritual essence in need of harmonizing
and liberation. By doing so, it was believed, one's health would be
preserved and life prolonged. Daoists even entertained the idea that one
could become immortal. To achieve these goals, techniques were
developed, including special dietary regimens, yoga, Chinese boxing,
meditation, and alchemy.

Over the course of the first millennium CE, Daoism also became a popular
and institutionalized religion. Daoist masters, claiming divine
inspiration, composed esoteric texts for their followers. These texts
explained how the natural world originated from a primordial ether
(*qi*) and its division into two polar forces: the *yin* and *yang* (see
Figure 4.9). They presented a universe with multiple heavenly and
hellish realms populated with divinities and demons. The principal
purpose of these Daoists was to attend to a person's physical and
psychological well-being. That involved not only teaching individual
techniques for preserving the life spirit but also the use of exorcism
and faith healing to remove malevolent influences. Daoists also
developed communal prayers and rituals that could cure illness, free
souls from hell, win blessings from heaven, and eliminate sins from the
community. Eventually, a Daoist church developed, with its own ordained
priesthood, temples, and monasteries.

## 4.8 THE QIN DYNASTY AND THE TRANSITION FROM ANCIENT TO IMPERIAL CHINA

In 219 BCE, while touring his realm, the **First Emperor of Qin**
\[cheen\] (259--210 BCE) erected a stone tablet atop a mountain with an
inscription proclaiming:

They \[the Qin ministers\] recall and contemplate the times of chaos:

When \[regional lords\] apportioned the land, established their states,
And thus unfolded the pattern of struggle.

Attacks and campaigns were daily waged;

They shed their blood in the open countryside. . . .

Now today, the August Emperor has unified All-under-Heaven into one
family---

Warfare will not arise again!

Disaster and harm are exterminated and erased,

The black-headed people live in peace and stability, benefits and
blessings are lasting and
enduring.[^\[2\]^](#chapter-004-chapter-4-china-and-east-asia-to-the-ming-dynasty.xhtml_footnote-329-2 "Adapted from a translation in Yuri Pines, “The Messianic Emperor: A New Look at Qin’s Place in China’s History,” 264-265."){#chapter-004-chapter-4-china-and-east-asia-to-the-ming-dynasty.xhtml_return-footnote-329-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"}

Indeed, just two years prior, in 221 BCE, the First Emperor had brought
the Warring States Period to a close by defeating the last remaining
state. Hence, he had realized the aspirations held by the many rulers he
subjugated---that is, to unify the known world under one powerful
monarch and, by so doing, to initiate an age of peace and prosperity,
one rooted in obedience to a sagely ruler.

The title "First Emperor of Qin," however, was assumed by this conqueror
only in the wake of his final victory, and it made sense. Having crushed
the many warring kingdoms, the First Emperor did indeed create something
new and more significant: an immense territorial state centrally
administered from his capital, by a monarch with unchallenged
sovereignty (see Map 4.7). So how did his state---the Qin
kingdom---prevail?

When the First Emperor inherited the Qin throne at the age of 13 in 246
BCE, he became King Zheng \[jung\], young ruler of the most powerful of
the seven remaining Warring States. Looking back, he would understand
that he had inherited a state whose origins dated back to the Western
Zhou Period, when land to the west of the Zhou kings was granted as a
fief to his chieftain forebearers. The Qin star first rose when a Qin
lord assisted King Ping in relocating to the eastern capital during the
transition from the Western to the Eastern Zhou Period (c. 770 BCE). At
that time, the old Zhou heartland was granted to him, and he was
elevated to the status of a regional lord, the Duke of Qin.

The Dukes of Qin were important players throughout the centuries of
warfare and alliances so characteristic of the Eastern Zhou, and
especially after the reforms of Duke Xiao \[she-ow\] (r. 361--338).
These reforms were based on the advice of his chancellor **Shang Yang**
\[shawng yawng\], an individual famed for being one of the founders of
another major intellectual tradition that developed during the Warring
States Period: **Legalism**. The legalists were in tune with the efforts
rulers were putting forth to strengthen their states. Their goal was to
devise the best techniques for organizing a state's territory and people
so as to maximize a ruler's power and control in times of both war and
peace. Legalists believed that the best way to do so was to concentrate
authority in one central administration governed by an absolute monarch.

To these ends, Shang Yang introduced many measures, laying the
foundations for future Qin greatness. He believed that the basis for
state power lay with an obedient and disciplined farming population
because that was the principal source of revenue and conscripts for the
army. So he organized villages across the land into units of five
families each and made the members of each unit responsible for each
other. Every member would be rewarded based on the amount of grain the
unit produced or the number of severed heads returned from the
battlefield. For meritorious service to the state, a unit could advance
along a system of ranks, each of which bestowed certain privileges. But
should any member commit a crime, everyone would be severely punished.
To make this more effective, the Qin state developed a legal code with
clear lists of penalties for specific crimes, made it publicly
available, and applied it uniformly to people regardless of their social
status. Also, the Qin was among the most effective in establishing a
civil service and county system to administer the law. Qin subjects
lived under a regime with a transparent set of expectations and also a
system of rewards and punishments. Such rationality in matters of
efficiently organizing a state through the uniform application of laws
and regularizing administration, as implemented by Shang Yang, was a
mark of legalist thinkers' methods.

</figure>

After Duke Xiao's and Shang Yang's time, Qin rulers assumed the title of
king and engaged in numerous battles, destroying several neighboring
states. Some of these were major engagements. According to one account,
after the Qin kingdom defeated the state of Zhao, a Qin general ordered
400,000 captured soldiers buried alive. Also, the Qin put an end to the
Zhou royal line after conquering their territory in 256 BCE. Hence, King
Zheng was heir to a kingdom whose success in battle derived in part from
legalist reforms. In line with that tradition, he too employed a
legalist advisor.

As of 230 BCE, only six other Warring States remained. Over the next
decade, King Zheng led a series of massive campaigns, each of which
entailed both sides fielding over one hundred thousand soldiers. This
was a bloody time, as one state after another fell. By 221 BCE, the
Chinese realm was unified under Qin rule.

Although the Qin Dynasty (221--207 BCE) was brief-lived, it had a
lasting effect on China because of the stable administrative foundation
it laid. The First Emperor of Qin and his advisors invented the title
used by all subsequent rulers. They made newly conquered territory a
part of their centralized bureaucracy. From his royal court and central
administration, the emperor governed a land organized into a
hierarchical system of commanderies (provinces that began as military
outposts) and counties. His regime standardized currency and the system
of writing and issued regulations for uniform weights and measures.

The emperor was also a great builder. Over 6800 kilometers of road were
laid to connect the capital at Xianyang to each province and the
northern border. Walls built by former northern states to protect
against non-Chinese nomads to their north were linked together in an
earlier version of the Great Wall. All of these measures served to
facilitate communication and commerce across the land and, therefore,
political stability and cultural unification. As a symbol of his power,
the First Emperor also constructed an imposing palace (see Figure 4.10)
and mausoleum (see Introduction). For all these reasons, historians mark
Qin unification as the beginning of China's imperial era.

## 4.9 THE HAN DYNASTY, 202 BCE--220 CE

After the First Emperor died in 210 BCE, the Qin Empire rapidly
disintegrated. Historians debate causes but highlight weak successors
manipulated by the intrigues of a high minister and court eunuch;
excessive demands on the population for building projects, tax revenue,
and military conscription; and a climate of fear created by the harshly
punitive legal system. Regardless, by 207 BCE, revolts were breaking out
across the land, as rebels accrued armies, seized territory, and even
declared themselves kings. China then fell into a state of civil war for
five years until the intervention of **Liu Bang** \[lee-oh bawng\] (d.
195 BCE). A former farmer and village headman who rebelled and built an
army and kingdom through his military acumen and charisma, Liu Bang
defeated his adversaries and declared himself emperor of a new dynasty.

### 4.9.1 Government and Society during the Han Dynasty

The Han Dynasty, ruled by 24 successive emperors from the Liu imperial
family, is normally divided into a Western Han (202--8 BCE) and Eastern
Han (25--220 CE) because for a brief time an imperial in-law usurped the
throne and established his own short-lived dynasty. This brief
interregnum aside, the Han Dynasty lasted 400 years, making it second in
length only to the Zhou Dynasty. So important was the Han to
establishing a pattern in Chinese civilization distinguishing people
belonging to it from those around them that Chinese people today refer
to their ethnic group as Han Chinese. Also, after adopting the
foundations laid by the Qin Dynasty, the Han further strengthened them,
cementing an imperial pattern that persisted in China until the fall of
the last dynasty (Qing) in 1911.

As opposed to studying a chronology of important events during these
centuries, let's consider the general picture for the political system
and society of the Han Empire. The majority of people---as much as 90
percent of the population---were farmers, living out their lives in
villages of a dozen to over 100 households. Some were independent
farmers who owned small farms; some, tenants who leased land from owners
of larger farms; and some, local magnates with large estates (see Figure
4.11). The government relied heavily on the first group for revenue and
conscription and therefore tried to keep these owner-farmers in business
with low taxes, relief in times of hardship, and improvement in their
agricultural methods. Unfortunately, over the course of the dynasty,
many farmers fell on hard times and were forced to sell their land to
powerful landlords, thus becoming their tenants or even slaves.
Landlordism thus became a major social and political problem, as local
great families dominated ever more dependent poor, undermining the
central government's revenue base.

The remaining ten percent of the population lived in urban areas---the
towns and cities of Han China---as artisans and traders or officials and
garrison soldiers. By some estimates, the total population during these
centuries hovered at 60 million, which means about six million were
urban residents. Many cities, such as the capitals of both the Western
and Eastern Han, had over 100,000 residents (see Map 4.9). The first
imperial capital, Chang'an \[chawng-an\] ("Forever Peace"), was a walled
city with twelve gates, watchtowers, market places, residential wards,
administrative buildings, and, of course, the imperial palace. Some of
the agricultural produce, manufactured goods, and raw materials filling
up the marketplaces testify to what artisans and traders were busy
making, buying, and selling: cooked meats, pickled vegetables, fish, and
grains; utensils and tools made of wood, brass, and iron; lacquer ware,
jade, and furs; and textiles fashioned from silk and hemp. Imperial
highways and lesser byways, and canals and other waterways, provided the
routes for moving these goods both within and beyond China. Ever
suspicious of the profit motive and believing in the foundational
importance of the farmer, government officials supervised city markets
and established agencies to regulate the most important industries.

These commoner classes---farmers, artisans, and traders---were governed
by a highly organized state and its corps of educated, professional
civil servants. For administrative purposes, the empire was eventually
divided into roughly 100 commanderies and 1300 counties. 130,000
officials constituted the bureaucracy. At the lowest level, working with
village and town leaders, county magistrates handled such matters as tax
collection, population registration, conscription for military service,
law and order, and public works. They submitted reports to, and took
orders from, commandery-level military and civil officials, who then did
the same with the nine ministries of the central government. These
ministries handled such matters as revenue, justice, and foreign
relations. The heads of each of these ministries, as well as two
chancellors, routinely held audiences with the emperor to decide all
policy matters. An independent branch of government, the censorate,
audited the rest and reported directly to the emperor.

From the outset, the Han Dynasty inherited the Qin legalist system of
government, with its emphasis on rational and efficient methods of
administration and use of systems of rewards and punishments to promote
order. However, early in the Han, Confucian scholars criticized Qin
governing for lacking humaneness, and Han rulers increasingly saw the
benefit of Confucian ideas to governing. This change was particularly
the case with **Emperor Wu** \[woo\] (r. 141--87 BCE). During his reign,
Confucius's ideas were molded into an ideology that legitimated monarchy
and a hierarchical social order. This ideology is called **Imperial
Confucianism**. As an ideology, it simply provided a blueprint for how
the political and social order should function.

Rulers saw the benefit in having officials who were highly educated,
loyal, and of good character and who understood the formalities of
ritual and etiquette. An Imperial Academy was founded at the capital in
124 so that students could be educated in classical Confucian texts,
including the *Analects*. Across the country, these students were
nominated by local officials based on their learnedness and virtuous
conduct. Successful graduates went on to serve as officials, and because
that conferred the highest prestige and status on an individual in Han
China, Confucian values penetrated society. Texts were compiled
explaining good etiquette, conduct, and ritual requirements for each
family member and members of society based on their superior or
subordinate status. Filial piety was celebrated in both art and texts
(see Figure 4.11), and law codes reinforced social norms by, for
example, supporting the authority of the family patriarch, division of
property among sons, and arranged marriages. In brief, over the course
of the Han Dynasty, Chinese increasingly identified themselves as
defenders of a Confucian civilization.

The emperor was at the pinnacle of both Han society and the political
system, while the imperial family and in-laws constituted a privileged
aristocracy. The emperor's authority derived in theory from his having
received the Mandate of Heaven, his virtue, and his role as mediator
between the celestial realms and human world; as such, he could expect
his subjects' obedience and loyalty. He resided within the walls of the
imperial palace at the capital city, attended by eunuchs who handled his
personal needs, palace administration, and the imperial harem. Emperors
had numerous consorts but also a principal wife---the empress---who held
a special status and was quite influential, usually because she bore the
heir to the throne, but also because she and her in-laws were an
intimate part of the emperor's palace life. Often, the imperial family,
imperial in-laws, eunuchs, and high officials broke apart into
squabbling factions fighting for power and influence; this contention
had deleterious consequences for the smooth functioning of the political
system.

### 4.9.2 China and the Outer World during the Han Dynasty

Strengthened by its ever more confident political system and society,
Han China also became an expansive empire, occupying and colonizing
territory all along its borders. Sometimes this process was gradual: as
migrants and merchants moved into neighboring areas, the government
followed by setting up garrisons to protect them and eventually counties
with civil servants to govern. In other cases, armies were sent to
subdue unstable borders or to secure trade routes. Regardless, as the
dominant power in the region, China's actions profoundly influenced and
shaped the history of peoples and states in neighboring areas of Central
and East Asia.

Traditionally, the biggest threats to the settled agricultural
population of China came from non-Chinese nomadic pastoralists scattered
about the steppe lands along the northern border (see Chapter Ten).
These skilled horsemen and hunters tended their herds from horseback,
resided in mobile campsites made up of yurts, and organized as tribes.
These tribes usually selected the most skilled male warriors as their
chieftains and also periodically organized into confederations so as to
raid Chinese villages and towns (see Chapter Ten). During the Han, the
most threatening confederation was knit together by Xiongnu
\[she-ong-new\]. The founding emperor, Liu Bang, sought to subdue them
with his armies but was defeated and forced to pay tribute and offer
imperial princesses in marriage to their chieftains. Emperor Wu,
however, enjoying a stronger government, sent massive armies of over
100,000 soldiers campaigning deep into Xiongnu territory, breaking up
their confederation and forcing them to relocate. Although his armies
suffered great losses, Emperor Wu established garrisons across the
northern border to consolidate his gains and protect China.

As Emperor Wu brought the Xiongnu under control, he became curious about
Central Asian territories lying to the west of China. Interested in
finding allies that might support him in his efforts to control nomad
confederations, he sent envoys on exploratory missions. They returned
with news of trade routes extending from oasis city-states ringing the
forbidding deserts of the Taklamakan Desert to countries lying beyond
the Pamir Mountains. What they were speaking of were the earliest **Silk
Roads** (see Map 4.9). Merchants had been using camels to carry such
goods as silk from China to distant civilizations while bringing back
gold, horses, and various handicrafts and foodstuffs. For that reason,
beginning in 104 BCE, Emperor Wu dispatched armies to subdue the region
as far as the Pamir Mountains, making the Han Dynasty overlords to
Central Asian states, which were now obligated to send tribute and
hostages. A frontier network of walls and watchtowers was then extended
partway into the region. The Silk Roads were thus secured, and because
it could be conducted more safely, the volume of traffic grew. During
the Han Dynasty, China demonstrated its intention of being a dominant
player in Central Asia.

### 4.9.3 Conclusion: The Han Dynasty and Empires in History

These are some of the outstanding features of the Han Empire, and ones
that can also be compared to other empires that existed at this time in
other parts of the world, such as Mauryan Empire in India (see Chapter
Three), Persian Empire in the Middle East (Chapter Five), or Roman
Empire (see Chapter Six). Each empire conferred a special status on
rulers, had an organized imperial administration with an educated civil
service, maintained a large army to defend an expanding and increasingly
well-defined territory, and developed an ideology and legal codes that
justified authority and reinforced social order. Confident in the
superiority of their organized governments, powerful militaries, and
worldview, each of these empires proceeded to extend control over
neighboring states and peoples.

## 4.10 THE PERIOD OF DIVISION, 220--589 CE

Like these other empires, the Han Dynasty also eventually fell. China
was then divided up by independent, short-lived kingdoms until 589 CE,
when the Sui Dynasty reunited most of the territory once controlled by
the Han. Thus, for four centuries, during what is known as the Period of
Division, China was politically unstable and racked by endemic warfare.
Yet, in spite of the violence, these centuries also saw vibrant cultural
developments, as Buddhism became an organized institutional religion
reshaping the spiritual landscape.

### 4.10.1 Political History---From Three Kingdoms (220--280) and the Western Jin (265--317) to the Northern and Southern Dynasties (317--589)

During the second century CE, a combination of factors led to massive
rebellions against the Han Dynasty by lower classes living in the
countryside. Many once thriving, independent farmers who fell on hard
times lost their land to powerful local families who used their
political connections to amass large estates. A series of floods and
droughts and the famines and epidemics they caused only worsened these
farmers' plight, and the government was ineffective in providing relief.
During the later Han, government revenue had fallen because local
magnates kept their growing estates off the tax rolls. Also, many later
Liu emperors were mere youths dominated by quarreling factions of
imperial in-laws and eunuchs, so the quality of governing declined.

Desperate to escape poverty and starvation, many villagers fled their
homes or joined roving bandit gangs. Some rallied behind individuals who
promised the dawn of a new age, thereby becoming part of large,
militarized religious societies with political goals. One was the
**Yellow Turbans**, a society named after the yellow cloth members
wrapped around their heads. The founder, Zhang Jue \[jawng joo-eh\],
claimed he was a devoted follower of the legendary Daoist philosopher
Laozi, who had by this time been deified and envisioned living in a
Daoist heaven. Zhang accrued a following of disciples by instructing
them in faith healing, establishing a rudimentary organization, and
prophesying an impending apocalypse. He led his followers to believe
that the apocalypse would be followed by an age of peace when the sky
would turn yellow and all would be equal. The movement grew into the
tens of thousands. Some followers proclaimed 184 CE was propitious,
daubing the characters for that year in mud on the gates to government
offices. The Yellow Turbans rebelled, and unrest spread across north
China. Other similar millenarian religious movements followed.

The Han Dynasty was in crisis but lacked the strong leadership of
earlier rulers like the founder Liu Bang or Emperor Wu. Youthful
emperors were forced to rely on generals who commanded permanent
standing armies around the empire as if they were private possessions.
But by empowering military strongmen to suppress rebellions, Han rulers
sealed the fate of the dynasty. Generals feuded amongst each other and
competed to impose a military dictatorship on the court. Eventually, in
220 CE, one general deposed the Han emperor, but he failed to unite the
realm because by that time the country had been divided up by three
kingdoms and their rival warlords.

Within their realms, each warlord sought to strengthen his hand against
the others by restoring order and establishing a functioning state.
After all, they needed fighting men and revenue. **Cao** **Cao**
(155--220 CE) was the most effective in achieving these goals. He was
the adopted son of a Han court eunuch and eventually entered the
military. As a commander, he earned his spurs leading Han armies against
the Yellow Turbans. As the dynasty fell apart, he gained control over it
and established a dictatorship in northern China. It was his son who
removed the last Han ruler and established the Wei \[way\] Dynasty
(220--265 AD), one of the **Three** **Kingdoms**.

By this time, as a result of the rebellions and civil wars, much land in
north China had gone to waste. So Cao Cao turned it into huge state
farms where he could settle his soldiers, landless poor, and, most
importantly, tribes of nomadic herders from the steppe lands to the far
north who had served him as he came to power. Thus, Cao rulers created
colonies of farmers who supplied tax revenue and, as hereditary military
families, soldiers for Wei armies. Such state-owned land and hereditary
soldiers became the mainstays of warlord dynasties throughout this time.
The two other kingdoms, Wu and Han, were located in the south. Over the
course of decades, the ruling warlords of all three states fought each
other in campaigns involving much treachery and stratagem. In 263 CE,
the Han kingdom fell to the invading forces of Wei commanders. But then,
just two years later, a powerful Wei family---the Sima---usurped the
throne and changed the kingdom's name to Western Jin \[jean\] (265--317
CE). The Western Jin conquered Wu in 280 BCE, thereby bringing to an end
the Three Kingdoms Period.

The Western Jin had reunified China, but that unity wasn't to last. The
policy of settling tribes of non-Chinese nomads in north China
backfired. Among them, rebel chieftains rose up, carved out kingdoms of
their own, and expanded their power all across the north. One Xiongnu
chieftain, Liu Yuan \[lee-oh you-anne\], even declared he was a
descendant of a Han Dynasty imperial princess and therefore had the
right to restore the Han Empire. His son descended on the Western Jin
court at Luoyang and eventually, in 317 CE, forced it to flee east to
Jiankang \[jeean cawng\] (today's city of Nanjing).

China was again divided up among competing dynasties, a state of affairs
that would persist until 589 CE, during a time referred to as the
**Northern and Southern Dynasties** (317--589). Six successive Southern
Dynasties were all located at Jiankang and had as their base of power
the Yangzi River basin. But their rulers were usually militarily weak
and lacked revenue due to southern China's comprising a colonial
frontier dominated by powerful families with large estates and private
armies. These families highly valued their pedigrees, intermarried, and
saw themselves as the heirs to Confucian civilization. At the southern
court, they dominated high offices, thus constituting a hereditary
aristocracy. The ruling family was always limited in power by their
influence.

The situation was even more complex in the north during those three
centuries. The kingdom established by Liu Yuan along the Yellow River
was just one of numerous short-lived Northern Dynasties established by
non-Chinese chieftains of different ethnicities. The Liu rulers, for
instance, were Xiongnu, while others were of Turkic ancestry. At times,
the north was divided among numerous rival regimes, while at others, it
was unified. But all of these kingdoms shared similar characteristics.
They were ruled by military dynasts who wanted to restore the Chinese
empire. Their armies consisted of an elite, heavily armored cavalry
drawn from aristocratic military families that was supplemented by
Chinese foot soldiers (see Figure 4.13). They employed educated Chinese
to serve as civil officials and administer their territories.

The Northern and Southern Dynasties came to an end in 589 CE after Yang
Jian \[yawng geean\], a general hailing from the ruling clan of a
northern kingdom, first established control over all of north China and
then defeated the last southern dynasty. He ruled his new Sui \[sway\]
Dynasty as Emperor Wen \[one\]. China was once again united under one
dynasty (see Map 4.13).

### 4.10.2 China's Third Great Tradition: The Introduction of Buddhism to China

Aside from the shifting configuration of kingdoms, perhaps the most
notable development during the Period of Division was the introduction
of Mahayana ("Great Vehicle") Buddhism into China (for the development
of Mahayana Buddhism, see Chapter Three). Beginning from the second
century CE, at the end of the Han Dynasty, Buddhist merchants and monks
from India and Central Asia brought their faith and scriptures to China
by the Silk Roads and maritime trading routes (see Map 4.11). The impact
was immense and can be compared to the Christianization of the
Mediterranean region and spread of devotional forms of Hinduism in South
Asia during this same period of time (see Chapters Three and Six).
Historians estimated that by the time the Sui Dynasty reunited China
four centuries later, China had approximately 33,000 Buddhist temples
and two million monks and nuns. Buddhism had become a large-scale
religious organization with these temples, clerics, and scriptures (see
Figure 4.14), as well as a widespread popular faith capturing the
imagination of common people and rulers alike.

</figure>

Historians have also hypothesized why this spread occurred. First of
all, Buddhism clearly met a spiritual need. During the Period of
Division, turmoil from rapid political change and constant warfare
brought much suffering and instability to people's lives. Now, a
religion explained suffering with notions of karma and rebirth and also
offered hope with paths to salvation and enlightenment. Buddhism placed
the world amidst visions of multiple hells and heavens where merciful
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas worked for the salvation of all beings.

Buddhism appealed to people in different ways. For scholarly elites
living in capital cities or as hermits in mountain retreats, Buddhist
doctrines about the nature of reality, self, and enlightenment were
appealing because they seemed similar to concepts in Daoist philosophy.
Both philosophies questioned the reality of ordinary understandings of
the self and world, emphasized that our desires create an illusory
world, and offered techniques for achieving liberation. Nirvana, for
instance, was compared to the Dao (Daoist "Way").

For rulers, Buddhism served political purposes. Since the faith became
so popular, rulers who took vows and sponsored temple construction and
the ordination of monks looked good because they were upholding the
dharma---that is, the Buddhist law. Some even went so far as to have
monks recognize them as incarnate Buddhas. Lastly, Buddhist
monks---whether foreign or Chinese---were some of the most educated
people at their courts and could assist rulers with mundane matters,
like international relations, but also esoteric ones, such as spells and
divination. Monks won support by promising that their rituals and
incantations had magical potency.

Lastly, for most people, Buddhism was a devotional religion. Buddhas and
Bodhisattvas were merciful beings to be worshipped because their good
karma redounded to the benefit of all beings. By going to a temple and
burning incense or praying and making offerings before a Buddha statue,
the faithful might have a simple wish granted: an illness cured, loved
ones helped, or a better rebirth ensured.

## 4.11 THE TANG DYNASTY AND THE EMERGENCE OF EAST ASIA

### 4.11.1 The Early Tang Dynasty

The Sui \[sway\] Dynasty did not last long (581--618 CE) and only had
two emperors: Emperor Wen and Emperor Yang. Both envisioned recapturing
the glory of the Han Dynasty; hence, they engaged in many construction
projects and military campaigns. Immense capital cities were built at
Chang'an and Luoyang, and in order to supply them with sufficient grain,
a canal system was created to connect the Yellow River to the Yangzi
River. These emperors also believed that Manchuria and the Korean
Peninsula were properly Chinese territory; therefore, they repeatedly
launched enormous military expeditions to attack the most powerful
Korean kingdom located there. Emperor Yang's ground and naval campaign
in 611 CE, for instance, required enlisting over one million combat
troops and hundreds of thousands of additional men just to transport
supplies. All of these campaigns met defeat.

What is more, that very same year, the Yellow River flooded, and
rebellions broke out along it. Natural disasters combined with these
emperors' heavy demands led to widespread unrest, and the Sui Dynasty
unraveled. Bandit leaders, local officials, and local elites took
matters into their own hands by organizing their communities for
self-defense. After the emperor took flight to the south, General Li
Yuan \[lee you-an\], who was stationed along the northern border to
defend against the steppe nomads, marched into Chang'an, where he
declared the founding of the Tang Dynasty (618--907 CE). Emperor Yang's
life came to an end when he was assassinated by his own men.

Like the Han Dynasty, the Tang was one of the most dynamic and
long-lived dynasties in China's history. That dynamism was made possible
by how effectively early Tang rulers consolidated the empire internally
and then engaged in military expansion (see Map 4.12). Consolidating the
empire required first reestablishing solid political, economic, and
military institutions. Fortunately, Tang rulers could draw upon nearly a
millennium of historical experience going back to the Qin Dynasty, when
a centralized monarchical political system governing all of China was
first established. At the capital, Tang emperors had at their disposal
sophisticated ministries that in turn oversaw a vast provincial and
county administrative system. To serve in high office, a man usually had
to come from one of a small number of highly prestigious families with
illustrious family pedigrees. These families took pride in their
superior education and manners and maintained their exclusiveness by
intermarrying. Thus, the Tang Dynasty was dominated by an aristocracy.
Nevertheless, some men from a larger pool of locally prominent families
entered the civil service based on merit, by graduating from colleges
located at the capitals or succeeding at civil service examinations (see
Figure 4.15).

In earlier times, empires rarely flourished without a solid agricultural
foundation and revenue base. To ensure sufficient grain and labor
service, Tang rulers believed that land must be equitably distributed to
farmers. So they implemented the **equal fields system**. In this
system, each family was to receive an equal plot of land (adjusted for
terrain and productivity) for life, as well as a smaller plot as a
permanent possession. The former was for growing grain, and the latter
for hemp and mulberry trees. In exchange, each farming family had to pay
a tax in grain and cloth and provide twenty days of labor service. To
make this work, officials carried out censuses and land surveys and
periodically redistributed land. Of course, this system was quite
onerous and difficult to carry out in practice, but it did function well
for about a century.

The Tang also flourished because special attention was paid to molding
an orderly society through the promulgation of sophisticated law codes.
From ancient times, in China, law was viewed as an expression of the
will of the emperor, whose pronouncements defined illegal conduct and
proper punishments for it. Also, law was critically important to
maintaining order, not only in the social but also in the natural world.
Crimes committed by both subjects and the state could disturb the cosmos
and lead to natural disasters. Thus, law maintained social and cosmic
harmony. That is why codes were so important.

The **Tang Code** contains twelve sections, one addressing general
principles and the rest administrative and penal law. Most of the
statutes define criminal offenses and the punishment for each of them.
The magistrate's role, then, was primarily to investigate and determine
precisely the nature of the crime so that the proper punishment could be
assigned. In Tang times, people believed that the severity of punishment
should be based on the relative status of the perpetrator and victim.
For instance, a crime committed against a family member was more serious
than one committed against a stranger, and a crime committed against an
official was more serious than one committed against a commoner. Within
families, too, the status of members mattered. Whereas a father could
flog his son without consequence, a son faced capital punishment should
he beat his father. In brief, Tang laws encoded the status hierarchy and
values of imperial Confucianism. The most serious crimes were those
committed against the emperor, country, senior family members, and
social superiors. Nevertheless, those of higher status were held
accountable for their actions; a magistrate who failed to justly
administer the law faced punishment. In fact, Tang monarchs were so
concerned that justice might fail to be upheld that they often
proclaimed amnesties, nullifying the sentences of all but the worst
criminals.

Lastly, Tang rulers established a formidable military. At first, the
army consisted of six hundred militias stationed at headquarters located
near the capitals and throughout the countryside, a large standing army
located at the capital, and frontier garrisons strung out along the
northern border. These forces were largely maintained by drawing men
from a military population. That is, Tang rulers relied on a large
number of families that maintained military traditions and provided sons
for periods of service in lieu of paying taxes and providing labor
service. As necessary, these men could be assembled into expeditionary
armies consisting of heavy cavalry and marching infantry (see Figure
4.16).

</figure>

Having laid these solid institutional foundations, the Tang Dynasty
followed with military expansion. Offensives waged to the north divided
up and subdued powerful Turkic khans and their confederations of steppe
nomads. Tang imperial power was then projected deep into Central Asia,
Manchuria, and northern Vietnam, making China the most dominant country
in East Asia in the seventh and eighth centuries.

### 4.11.2 The Emergence of East Asia: The Case of Korea and Japan

In the introduction, we defined East Asia in both geographic and
cultural terms, highlighting Korea and Japan. East Asia first emerges as
an identifiable cultural sphere during the Tang Dynasty. By Tang times,
kingdoms had already emerged on the Korean Peninsula and the main
islands of Japan, but it was during the Tang that ruling elites in both
of these states made extensive efforts to adapt components of the
Chinese political, legal, and writing system, as well as of Chinese
culture, to their own societies.

#### 4.11.2.1 Korea's History from the Fourth Century BCE to 900 CE

We have already learned about China's history from the Han Dynasty (203
BCE--220 CE) through the Period of Division (220--589 CE) and into the
Tang Dynasty. During those same centuries, the first states formed on
the Korean Peninsula, and historians generally organize that time into
three periods: the early historical period (c. 400 BCE--313 CE), **Three
Kingdoms Period** (313--668 CE), and the **Silla Dynasty** (668--892
CE).

By the fourth century BCE, the peninsula had already long been populated
by peoples who had migrated there from northeast Asia and settled into
agricultural villages. These peoples were not originally speakers of
Chinese; rather, they spoke languages belonging to the Altaic language
family, which possibly includes Korean. This point is important because
people unfamiliar with East Asia sometimes think that the languages
*spoken* by Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, and Vietnamese are closely
related, when in fact they are quite different. However, it is also
important to note that in ancient times throughout East Asia, the
Chinese writing system was adopted by literate elites for the purpose of
writing their spoken languages. Only over time were native scripts
developed out of it.

The political picture for the early historical period is complex because
the peninsula and neighboring Manchuria looked like a mosaic of chiefdom
confederations and petty kingdoms, each governed by elite families
living in walled towns. These polities first took shape during these
centuries. By the early centuries CE, three kingdoms extending from
Manchuria to where Seoul lies today (the capital of South Korea) covered
the northern half, while the southern half was divided up by
confederations of chiefdoms. The most powerful kingdom was **Goguryeo**
(\[Ko-gooryo\] c. 37 BCE--668 CE).

The Korean Peninsula lies very close to China, with only Manchuria and
the Yellow Sea dividing the two states. Long before Korea's early
historical period, rulers of Chinese states had taken an interest in
controlling both trade routes leading into this region and the peoples
living there. In 108 BCE, during the Han Dynasty, Emperor Wu even sent
expeditions into Manchuria and Korea. He opened up a corridor leading
from China through Manchuria into the peninsula and established four
commanderies to control the area (see Map 4.13).

But Han China by no means colonized the entirety of this northeastern
region. Kingdoms and tribal confederations remained to the east and
south, most notably Goguryeo. After the Han Dynasty collapsed, northern
China was in turmoil and unable to control these frontiers. In 313 CE,
King Mich'on of Goguryeo, in an effort to expand the size of his
kingdom, seized Chinese territory. That date marked the beginning of a
new stage in Korean history referred to as the **Three Kingdoms Period**
(313 CE--668 CE).

The Three Kingdoms were Goguryeo, Baekje \[peck-jay\], and **Silla**
\[she-la\] (see Map 4.14). Like Goguryeo, the early histories of Baekje
and Silla date back to the early historical period, during which time
they were consolidated from southern chiefdom confederations (see Map
4.13). Each kingdom was dominated by a warrior elite composed of the
ruling and aristocratic clans. For most of the Three Kingdoms Period,
Goguryeo was the dominant military and political power, spreading its
control over much of Manchuria and northern Korea. During the fifth
century CE, its capital was moved to Pyongyang, site of a former Han
Commandery. This move made this city---the capital of North Korea
today---important to Korean history. Murals on Goguryeo tombs located in
the vicinity show what this kingdom's elites valued (see Figure 4.17).
They are depicted as heavily-clad warriors fighting on horseback with
bows and arrows and swords and halberds. A cosmos depicts guardian
spirits and nature gods belonging to a native Korean tradition of
shamanism.

Given the geopolitical position of Korea, it is not surprising that all
three kingdoms highly valued martial traditions. First of all, they
fought with each other for control over territory and resources on the
peninsula. Secondly, positioned as Korea is between China and Japan,
those states often intruded upon peninsular conflicts. For all these
reasons, Silla, Baekje, and Goguryeo monarchs readily borrowed ideas
from China that might benefit their realms and give them more power.
That borrowing included introducing elements of Chinese political
institutions and legal traditions, as well as Buddhism and Confucianism.
All of these kingdoms sent students to study in China and patronized
Chinese Buddhist monks and learned Confucians who visited their courts.
These visitors were knowledgeable in many fields of learning, including
science and technology. As we have seen, Buddhism promised not only
salvation but also magical powers of healing, and rulers could style
themselves as living Buddhas. That is why they sponsored the building of
temples and formation of a Buddhist religious order. Confucianism, on
the other hand, provided models of civility, courtly etiquette, and
bureaucratic governance for ruling elites, and rulers could style
themselves in Chinese fashion as sovereign monarchs. Hence, Confucian
academies were established to train students of aristocratic families
for service.

Towards the end of the Three Kingdoms Period, however, it was not the
great northeastern power of Goguryeo that unified the Korean Peninsula.
This achievement went to the Silla Dynasty and did so for two reasons.
First, Silla rulers were particularly effective in using Chinese
political practices to centralize their power. They adopted
Chinese-style titles, central government agencies, and law codes; made
Buddhism a state-sponsored religion; and established an academy for
studying Chinese classical texts, law, medicine, and astronomy. Second,
Silla monarchs built alliances with Tang emperors that worked to their
advantage. As we have seen, the Chinese Sui Dynasty fell because Sui
rulers suffered terrible defeats at the hands of the armies of the great
kingdom of Goguryeo. Tang Dynasty rulers continued the invasions but
also failed. For that reason, they were open to building alliances with
Silla and combining their military forces. Together, they defeated
Baekje in 660 and Goguryeo in 668. Much to the Tang emperor's surprise,
Silla then drove out Tang forces, preventing any efforts on China's part
to control the Korean Peninsula. The Silla Dynasty (668--892 CE) thus
became the first one to unify the peninsula (see Map 4.16).

In sum, Goguryeo and the Silla Dynasty were, in succession, two of the
most powerful kingdoms in ancient Korea. Their histories were deeply
shaped by the intrusion of Chinese states into the region. For that
reason, they can be categorized as instances of **secondary state
formation**. Throughout history, some states developed and centralized
their control over a territory largely in response to the impact of a
powerful neighboring state that had developed before them. As they did
so, they also borrowed ideas for how states should be organized from
that neighboring power, even as native traditions and language are
retained.

#### 4.11.2.2 Japan from the Yayoi Period to the Seventh Century

Those who follow the history of World War II might know that during
those years, the highest authority in Japan was Emperor Hirohito. Even
today, Japan has an emperor and empress, although they no longer have
any formal political power in this now democratic nation and rather
serve in a cultural and symbolic role. Interestingly, the Japanese
monarchy is the oldest continuous one in the history of the world and
traces its beginnings to at least the fourth century CE.

Japan's early historical development presents unique characteristics
because of its geography. The island archipelago was close enough to
Chinese and Korean states to borrow from them and benefit from migration
and yet far enough away so that invasions were never a sudden impetus to
change (see Map 4.14). Therefore, although we can also speak of
**secondary state formation** for Japan, that is largely because of the
conscious choice on the part of ruling elites to adopt political ideas
and cultural patterns from China and Korea.

But even during the prehistoric period, geography impacted Japan's
development in other ways. The first evidence for Paleolithic
hunter-gatherers dates back to c. 30,000 BCE. In the resource-rich
environments of mountainous and forested Japan, small bands of mobile,
multi-generational families were able to thrive on game, shellfish,
fruits, tubers, and nuts. In fact, foraging strategies were so
successful that even when sedentary village communities first formed,
they thrived without agriculture. This period of time is known as the
**Jōmon** \[joe-moan\] **Period** (c. 11,000--500 BCE). The
archaeological record reveals that up and down the archipelago, foragers
had settled into permanent base camps. These were hamlet communities
made up of pit dwellings for homes and raised floor structures for
holding community functions. Jōmon, meaning "cord-marked," refers to the
type of pottery they used (see Figure 4.18). This case is one of the few
in prehistory where a culture invented and used pottery long before
farming.

Period, dating to c. 3000 BCE. Author: User “Morio” Source: Wikimedia

</figure>

Farming began during the next stage in Japanese history---the **Yayoi**
\[ya-yo-ee\] **Period** (500 BCE--250 CE). The label refers to a site
near Tokyo where artifacts were discovered evidencing new developments
in Japan. Most importantly, rice-paddy agriculture and dry-field farming
were introduced, techniques that supported population growth and the
formation of more and larger village communities. The impetus to
agriculture was likely earlier experimentation with simple horticulture,
a warming climate, and migration from mainland East Asia. Those migrants
also brought knowledge of iron and bronze-working; hence, tools and
weapons fashioned from metals became widespread.

During the early centuries of Yayoi, small village communities
proliferated across the main islands of Japan, but during the latter
half, they evolved into something more substantial. Archaeologists have
excavated the foundations of large settlements surrounded by moats and
embankments (see Figure 4.19). These fortified bastions were home to up
to two thousand residents and contained ceremonial centers,
differentiated residences and burials, watchtowers, and palisades. Some
burials contained skeletons evidencing wounds or dismemberment.
Combining this evidence with clues from contemporary Chinese historical
sources, specialists have concluded that by the end of the Yayoi Period,
powerful chiefdoms had emerged in Japan, and they were allying with and
battling each other to control trade routes and territory.

</figure>

In retrospect, the late Yayoi Period clearly was a transitional phase
leading to the formation of the first kingdom in Japanese history. That
happened in the next stage, the **Mounded Tomb Period** (250--600 CE).
Among the warring chiefdoms, one emerged as dominant. Hailing from the
Kinai region of Japan (see Map 4.1), Yamato chieftains expanded their
power through force and diplomacy and eventually forged a kingdom (see
Map 4.19). The principal evidence for their growing power are the
massive, keyhole-shaped tombs giving this period its name. In fact,
nearly ten thousand tombs have been identified, but the largest ones
belong to the Yamato rulers, the ancestors to the long-lived Japanese
imperial line. Although the large royal ones have not yet been
excavated, smaller tombs containing an abundance of horse trappings,
iron weapons, and armor provide evidence that mounted warfare was
introduced from the Korean Peninsula, perhaps accelerating the pace of
state formation.

As they conquered more territory, Yamato rulers devised strategies for
strengthening their monarchy and incorporating leaders of the many
powerful chieftain clans dominating local areas up and down the
archipelago. For service at their royal court or as provincial
officials, they granted them office and noble titles, thereby building a
coalition of great clans. In addition, in the sixth century CE, Yamato
rulers began to study the great Sui (581--618 CE) and Tang (618--907 CE)
Dynasties in China and to introduce reforms based upon what they
learned. The next two centuries in Japanese history, the **Asuka-Nara
Period** (c. 600--800 CE), were defined by these Chinese-style reforms,
although the name itself refers to the successive locations of the royal
court.

**Prince** **Shōtoku** \[showtoe-coo\] (573--621 CE) and **Empress**
**Suiko** \[sue-ee-ko\] (r. 593--628) led the way by sending several
embassies to the capital of China and then remodeling their capital and
court. In his "Seventeen Article Constitution," Shōtoku called for the
introduction of Buddhism and Confucian ethics. His articles, for
instance, stated that the sovereign's relation to subjects was like
Heaven's to the earth, and his or her commands should thus be obeyed.
Empress Suiko adopted the title "Heavenly Monarch," thus shifting the
character of the monarch from a martial king to a Chinese-style
sovereign. In brief, they introduced a Confucian-oriented,
emperor-centered state ideology that clearly established a hierarchical
system of ranks and norms for court etiquette. For the remainder of this
period, other reformers and monarchs would only deepen the reforms by
introducing Chinese-style law codes. These laws reshaped the government
and land according to a bureaucratic and administrative structure very
similar to that of Tang China. Nevertheless, distinctly Japanese
patterns remained throughout this time. First, the royally-recognized
great clans of earlier times evolved into an aristocratic class that
dominated the court and the upper ranks of officialdom. Secondly, in
addition to establishing a council to manage the growing numbers of
Buddhist temples and clerics, the court established a Council of Kami
Affairs to oversee native Japanese religious traditions. That tradition
is known as **Shinto** \[sheen-toe\], or the "Way of the Kami."

Shinto began in prehistoric times as reverence for kami---spirits and
deities associated with natural phenomena, such as the sun or moon.
Really, anything mysterious might become a kami, including a mountain,
charismatic ruler, or serpent. During the Yayoi and Mounded Tomb
Periods, these kami became the subjects of myths that explained their
origins and powers, and shrines were erected to house sacred objects
symbolizing them. By properly purifying oneself, conducting rituals, and
praying to a kami, an individual could avert a disaster and ensure his
own or the community's well-being. Also, clans would claim important
kami as their guardian spirits and fashion stories about how their
ancestors descended from them. In fact, Yamato monarchs claimed they
were descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu and constructed a shrine
at Ise \[ee-say\] to house her kami body (see Figure 4.20). Finally,
during the Asuka-Nara Period, the Yamato court developed a centralized
system to keep track of and regulate Shinto shrines throughout its
realm, thereby harnessing higher powers to support its claim to rule the
land.

In sum, like Korea, Japan's history was highly impacted by developments
in China, even as native languages, traditions, and creative adaptation
remained foundational to the unique identities of each. However, Korea
was far more subject to the intrusion of Chinese states in the Korean
Peninsula, something that did not happen in Japan. Rather, as the first
state formed on the archipelago, ruling elites looked to China for ideas
as to how the kingdom might be governed. In the course of doing so, they
also introduced the great tradition of Mahayana Buddhism.

### 4.11.3 The Decline and Collapse of the Tang Dynasty

The Tang Dynasty reached its zenith during the eighth century under the
reign of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712--756 CE), but then went into decline.
At first, the problem was overexpansion. Tang rulers had expanded the
empire's boundaries in nearly every direction, including far into
Central Asia. To defend the northwestern border, a system of regional
frontier commands was established, each with its own commander and
professional army. The earlier system of militias and garrisons manned
by hereditary military families declined.

This decline turned out to be dangerous. After one general, An Lushan,
butted heads with the emperor's chief minister, he marched his frontier
army of 100,000 soldiers south to the capital, forcing the court to
flee. An was eventually executed by his own men, and a Tang emperor
returned to the throne, but the turmoil unleashed by this rebellion
rendered the Tang Dynasty ineffective. During the ensuing turmoil, the
empire shrank and Central Asia was lost. Also, both Tang supporters and
pardoned rebels were granted military governorships, giving them control
over provinces. Many then chose not to remit tax revenue to the central
government, appointed their own subordinates, and designated their
successors. They had, in effect, become warlords with their own loyal,
regional bases.

Furthermore, as the political system decentralized in this way, the
system of equitable land distribution collapsed. Thus, much like during
the end of the Han Dynasty, landlords used their power and influence to
build great estates. Large numbers of farmers ended up without land and
survived only by joining bandit gangs or the ranks of warlord armies.
When droughts and famine hit in the late ninth century, a massive
rebellion broke out. The last Tang emperor was turned into a puppet by
military commanders and eventually, in 907 CE, abdicated. China then
entered yet another period of division until the Song Dynasty restored
order in 960 CE.

## 4.12 THE SONG DYNASTY

Like every Chinese dynasty before it, the Song Dynasty (960--1279 CE)
was born out of turmoil and warfare. After the Tang Dynasty fell, China
was once again divided up by numerous contending kingdoms. The founder
of the Song, **Zhao** **Kuangyin** \[j-ow kwong-yeen\], was a military
commander and advisor to the emperor of one of these kingdoms, but after
he died and his six-year-old son came to the throne, Zhao staged a coup.
He left the capital with his troops, ostensibly to fight enemies to the
north. But just outside the capital, his troops instead proclaimed him
emperor, a title he accepted only with feigned reluctance and after his
followers promised obedience and to treat the child emperor and people
living in the capital environs humanely. On February 3, 960, the child
was forced to abdicate, and Zhao took the throne as Emperor Taizu
\[tiedzoo\]. He and his brother, the succeeding Emperor Taizong
\[tie-dzawng\], ruled for the first forty years of a dynasty that would
last over three hundred, laying the foundations for its prosperity and
cultural brilliance. The Song Dynasty saw a total of eighteen emperors
and is most notable for the challenges it faced from northern conquest
dynasties, economic prosperity, **a civil service examination system**
and the educated elite of **scholar-officials** it created, cultural
brilliance, and **foot binding**.

During the Song, China once again confronted tremendous challenges from
conquests by military confederations located along the northern border.
So threatening and successful were these that the Song Dynasty counted
as just one of many powerful players in a larger geopolitical system in
Central and East Asia. The first two northern conquest dynasties, the
Liao \[lee-ow\] and Jin \[jean\], emerged on the plains of Manchuria
when powerful tribal leaders organized communities of hunters, fishers,
and farmers for war.

As their power grew, they formed states and conquered territory in
northern China, forcing the Chinese to pay them large subsidies of silk
and silver for peace. So Chinese rulers and their councilors were in
constant negotiations with peoples they viewed as culturally-inferior
barbarians under conditions where they were forced to treat them as
equals, as opposed to weaker tribute-paying states in a
Chinese-dominated world. At first, they used a combination of defensive
measures and expensive bilateral treaties, which did make for a degree
of stability. Halfway through the Song, the Jin Dynasty destroyed the
Liao and occupied the entire northern half of China, forcing the Song
court to move south. To rule Chinese possessions, Jin rulers even took
on the trappings of Chinese-style emperors and developed a dual
administrative system. Steppe tribes were ruled by a traditional
military organization, while the farming population of China was
governed with Chinese-style civilian administration. The Song Dynasty
thus constantly faced the prospect of extinction and was challenged in
its legitimacy by rival emperors claiming the right to rule the Chinese
realm.

One reason Song monarchs were able to buy peace was the extraordinary
prosperity during their rule and the resulting tax revenue made
available. During those centuries, China was by many measures the most
developed country in the world. In 1100 CE, the population was one
hundred million, more than all of medieval Europe combined. That number
doubled the population of 750 CE, just three hundred years prior. The
reason for such growth was flourishing agricultural production,
especially rice-paddy agriculture. More drought-resistant and
earlier-ripening strains of rice, combined with better technology, lead
to higher yields per acre.

The impact was enormous. The productivity of farmers stimulated other
industries, such as ironworking. Estimates place iron production at as
high as twenty thousand tons per year. That amount made iron prices low
and, therefore, such products as spades, ploughshares, nails, axles, and
pots and pans more cheaply available. Seeing its profitability, wealthy
landowning and merchant families invested in metallurgy, spurring better
technology. Bellows, for instance, were worked by hydraulic machinery,
such as water mills. Explosives derived from gunpowder were engineered
to open mines. Similar development of textile and ceramic industries
occurred.

Indeed, during the Song, China underwent a veritable economic
revolution. Improvements in agriculture and industry, combined with a
denser population, spurred the **commercialization** of the economy. A
commercialized economy is one that supports the pursuit of profit
through production of specialized products for markets. A Song farmer,
for instance, as opposed to just producing rice to get by, might rather
purchase it on a market and instead specialize in tea or oranges. Since
markets were proliferating in towns and cities and transport via land
and water was now readily available, farmers could rely on merchants to
market their goods across the country. To support this economic
activity, the government minted billions of coins each year as well as
the world's first paper currency.

A denser population and sophisticated economy led to urbanization.
During the Song, at a time when London had roughly fifteen thousand
people, China had dozens of cities with over fifty thousand people and
capitals with a half million. Song-painted scrolls show crowds of people
moving through streets lined with shops, restaurants, teahouses, and
guest houses (see Figure 4.21).

To manage their realm, Song rulers implemented a national **civil
service examination** to recruit men for office. Prior dynasties had
used written examinations testing knowledge of Confucian classics to
select men for office, but only as a supplement to recommendation and
hereditary privilege. During the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, however,
aristocratic families that had for centuries dominated the upper
echelons of officialdom disappeared. The first Song emperor, Zhao
Kuangyin, rode to power with the support of military men; having largely
unified China, he then sought to restore civil governance based in
Confucian principles of humaneness and righteousness. So he invited
senior commanders to a party and, over a cup of wine, asked them to
relinquish their commands for a comfortable retirement. They obliged. He
and his successors consequently made the examination system the
pre-eminent route to office, even establishing a national school system
to help young men prepare for and advance through it. Thus, during the
Song Dynasty, civil offices came to be dominated by men who had spent
years, even decades, preparing for and passing through a complex series
of exams. Hence, they were both scholars and officials. Success in
entering this class placed a person at the pinnacle of society,
guaranteeing them prestige and wealth. These **scholar-officials**, and
their Confucian worldview, dominated Chinese society until the twentieth
century.

In theory, since any adult male could take the examinations, the system
was meritocratic. But in reality, because they were so difficult and
quotas were set, very few actually passed them. Estimates suggest that
only one in one hundred passed the lowest level exam. This ratio meant
that in order to succeed, a young man had to begin memorizing long
classical texts as a child and to continue his studies until he passed
or gave up hope. Only affluent families could afford to support such an
education.

Nevertheless, the meritocratic ideal inspired people from all classes to
try and so promoted literacy and a literary revival during the Song
Dynasty. As a part of this revival and to provide a curriculum for
education, scholar-officials sought to reinvigorate Confucianism. The
philosophical movement they began is known as **Neo-Confucianism**. By
the Song Dynasty, whereas Confucianism largely shaped personal behavior
and social mores, Buddhist and Daoist explanations of the cosmos, human
nature, and the human predicament dominated the individual's spiritual
outlook. Neo-Confucians responded to this challenge by providing a
metaphysical basis for Confucian morality and governance. **Zhu Xi**
(1130--1200), arguably the most important philosopher in later imperial
Chinese history, produced a grand synthesis that would shape the
worldview of the scholar-official class. He argued that the cosmos
consists of a duality of principles and a material force composing
physical things. One principle underlies the cosmos, and individual
principles provide the abstract reason for individual things. In human
beings, principle manifests as human nature, which is wholly good and
the origins of the human capacity to become moral persons. However, an
individual's physical endowment obscures their good nature and leads to
moral failings, which is why a rigorous Confucian curriculum of moral
self-cultivation based in classical texts like Confucius's *Analects* is
necessary. Most importantly, Zhu Xi argued, individual morality was the
starting point for producing a well-managed family, orderly government,
and peace throughout the world.

Furthermore, during the Song Dynasty, moveable-type printing also began
to be widely used, contributing to an increase in literacy and broader
exposure to these new ideas. Chinese characters were carved on wood
blocks, which were then arranged in boxes that could be dipped in ink
and printed on paper (see Figure 4.22). Books on a multitude of
topics---especially classics and histories---became cheaply and widely
available, fueling a cultural efflorescence at a time when education had
become paramount to climbing the social ladder. Other inventions that
made China one of the most technologically innovative during this time
include gunpowder weapons (see Figure 4.23) and the mariner's compass.

Looked at from many angles, then, the Song was truly a dynamic period in
China's history. However, some observers have bemoaned the fact that
**foot binding** began during this dynasty and see that practice as a
symbol of increasing gender oppression. Scholars believe foot binding
began among professional dancers in the tenth century and was then
adopted by the upper classes. Over time, it spread to the rest of
Chinese society, only to end in the twentieth century. At a young age, a
girl's feet would be wrapped tightly with bandages so that they couldn't
grow, ideally remaining about four-inches long. That stunting made
walking very difficult and largely kept women confined to their homes.
Eventually, the bound foot, encased in an embroidered silk slipper,
became a symbol of femininity and also one of the criteria for
marriageability (see Figure 4.24).

More generally, social norms and the law did place women in a
subordinate position. Whereas men dominated public realms like
government and business, women married at a young age and lived out most
of their lives in the domestic sphere. Indeed, in earlier times, China
was patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal. It was patriarchal because
the law upheld the authority of senior males in the household and
patrilineal because one's surname and family property passed down the
male line---though a wife did have control over her dowry. Importantly,
ancestor worship, the pre-eminent social and religious practice in
Chinese society, was directed toward patrilineal forbears. That is why
it was important for the woman to move into the spouse's home, where she
would live together with her parents-in-law. Patrilocal describes this
type of social pattern. Marriages were almost always arranged for the
benefit of both families involved, and during the wedding ceremony, the
bride was taken in a curtained sedan chair to the husband's home, where
she was to promise to obey her parents-in-law and then bow along with
her husband before the ancestral altar. Ideally, she would become a
competent household manager, educate the children, and demonstrate much
restraint and other excellent interpersonal skills.

Although gender hierarchy was, therefore, the norm, other scholars have
observed that ideals were not always reality and women did exercise
their agency within the boundaries placed upon them. A wife could gain
dignity and a sense of self-worth by handling her roles capably; she
would also earn respect. Song literature further reveals that women were
often in the fields working or out on city streets shopping. Among the
upper classes, literacy and the ability to compose essays or poetry made
a woman more marriageable. For this reason, some women were able to
excel. Li Qingzhao \[lee ching-jow\] (c. 1084--1155) is one of China's
greatest poets (see Figure 4.26). She came from a prestigious
scholar-official family. Her father was both a statesman and classical
scholar, and her mother was known for her literary achievements. In her
teens, Li began to compose poetry, and over the course of her life, she
produced many volumes of essays and poems. Poems to her husband even
suggest mutual love and respect and treating her as an equal. In fact,
throughout Chinese history, it was not unusual for women to challenge
and transgress boundaries. At the highest level, during both the Han and
Tang Dynasties, we find cases of empress dowagers dominating youthful
heirs to the throne and even one case of an empress declaring her own
dynasty.

## 4.13 THE YUAN DYNASTY

The last major dynasty prior to China's early modern period is the
**Yuan** \[you-an\] **Dynasty**. Like earlier neighbors lying to the
north of the Song, the Yuan was also a northern conquest dynasty. The
key players here were steppe nomads living on the grasslands of
Mongolia, known as Mongols, and their leader Genghis Khan. The story of
their rise and how they created the largest territorial empire in the
history of the world properly belongs to Chapter Eleven, which covers
Central Asia, so we here only provide a brief introduction. The most
important point to bear in mind is that the Mongols conquered many
countries, including China, and incorporated them into a large Eurasian
empire.

In the twelfth century CE, the Mongols were one of many tribes of
nomadic pastoralists living on the steppes of Central Asia. Although
these tribes were made up of peoples of differing ethnicity, they held
in common a way of life. Since the steppe was unsuited to farming, they
relied principally on their herds but also on what they could obtain by
trading with neighboring sedentary peoples. The nomads lived in
temporary campsites, periodically breaking down their yurts and
relocating as the seasons required. Since the tribes often fought with
each other or turned to raiding, nomads were also excellent at mounted
warfare. Their chieftain leaders---referred to as khans---were usually
selected based on skill in battle and charisma.

Undoubtedly, the most famous khan in Central Asian history is Genghis
Khan. In the late twelfth century, he accrued an army of loyal followers
and began to subdue tribes across the Mongolian steppe. In 1206 CE, at a
gathering of tribal leaders, he was proclaimed Universal Khan of a
tribal confederation. Using a powerful military with a tight command
structure, Genghis proceeded to unleash a wave of campaigning in
northern China and Central Asia, thereby adding much territory to a
growing Mongol Empire (see Map 4.16). After he died in 1227 CE, this
empire was divided into four khanates, each of which went to one of his
four sons as their territorial inheritance.

Tolui, Genghis Khan's youngest son, was granted the Mongol homeland as
well as subjugated territory in northern China held by the Jin Dynasty.
But this rugged warrior died in 1232 at the young age of forty, so the
task of managing Chinese territory fell to Tolui's capable wife
Sorghagtani Beki and her second son, **Kublai Khan** (1215--1294 CE).
Unlike his predecessors, who largely treated Chinese as chattel and
ruthlessly exploited their towns and villages, Kublai saw the advantages
of taking a more enlightened approach. With the advice of Chinese
advisors, he adopted Chinese-style methods for governing China. In fact,
after Kublai was elected as the fifth Universal Khan in 1260, he chose
to move his capital from Mongolia to Beijing, making it the center of
his khanate. He then took on the trappings of a Chinese-style sovereign
and, in 1273, declared the founding of the Great Yuan Dynasty.
Accordingly, he asserted that the Mandate of Heaven had been transferred
to him from the Song Dynasty.

alt="Portrait of Kublai Khan" />
<figcaption>Figure 4.27 | Portrait of Kublai Khan Author: User “Yaan”

</figure>

Kublai then engaged in a decade of conquest that concluded with the fall
of the Song. This victory over the Song Dynasty, China required careful
preparation. The Song was located in the southern two-thirds of China,
where the terrain was matted with lakes, rivers, and canals. The Mongols
had little experience with naval warfare, so they turned to Chinese
advisors to build a navy. Mongol cavalry boarded the ships and floated
down rivers leading to the Song capital, laying siege to cities along
the way. When they reached it in 1276, Kublai's generals took the
capital without bloodshed. The regent to the young Song emperor worked
out conditions for surrender to them. Hence, the Mongol Yuan Dynasty had
won control over China. After Kublai died, nine of his descendants ruled
as emperors until the dynasty fell to native rebellions in 1368.

Historians differently assess the impact of Mongol Yuan rule on China.
Earlier generations of historians judged that violent Mongol conquests
devastated the land and led to a population drop. The Mongol style of
rule was despotic. Rather than sustain the openness of Chinese society
and use the merit-based examination system to bring talent into their
government, Mongol rulers placed Chinese in rigid occupational
categories and suspended the exams. Many capable men simply avoided
official service and turned to other professions.

</figure>

Recent studies, however, offer a more positive assessment. Because Yuan
rulers followed the counsel of Confucian advisors and adopted
traditional Chinese methods for governing, for most, Chinese life went
on as before. Early on, much attention was also paid to the farming
population. To promote agriculture, Yuan rulers provided relief measures
and promoted the formation of rural cooperatives. Also, Mongols highly
valued crafts and implemented policies that greatly benefited artisans
and promoted their work. Hence, arts such as textiles and ceramics
flourished (see Figure 4.27). Finally, the assessment of Yuan rule in
China should be linked to a broader assessment of the impact of Mongol
rule on world history (see Chapter Eleven). While duly acknowledging the
devastation caused by Mongol conquests, historians also find much merit
in Mongol patronage of arts and support for constructions projects and
advancements in the areas of medicine and astronomy. Most importantly,
the massive Eurasian empire they forged initiated a new era of trade and
contacts between Europe and China, as well as the regions lying between.

## 4.14 CONCLUSION

We have now passed through nearly four millennia of East Asian history.
We prefaced that history with the development of Neolithic cultures
leading up to the second millennium BCE, at which point the first
kingdoms in Chinese history emerged. Longshan culture (3000--1900 BCE)
consisted of competing chiefdoms that laid the foundations for the
emergence of the first major states.

The first major state was the Xia Dynasty (c. 1900--1600 BCE). Although
historians debate whether or not it was legendary and lack written
sources from that time, the archaeological evidence points to a Bronze
Age civilization with a capital city at Erlitou. The next dynasty, the
Shang (c. 1600--1046 BCE), brings us into history proper because we have
written evidence in the form of oracle bones and bronze inscriptions.
The last Shang capital was located at Anyang on the North China Plain
near the Yellow River. The dynasty's most important legacies were the
earliest form of Chinese writing and ancestor worship. The oracle bones
were used to divine the will of higher powers and the spirits of
deceased Shang kings.

The next dynasty, the Zhou Dynasty (1045--256 BCE), began when
chieftains to the west of the Shang declared themselves kings and
overthrew it. They justified doing so with the Mandate of Heaven, which
states that a higher power withdraws its support from corrupt ruling
families and transfers it to righteous ones. Because it lasted eight
hundred years and saw much change, the Zhou is divided into two major
periods, the Western (1045--771 BCE) and Eastern Zhou (770--256 BCE).
During the Western Zhou, Zhou kings ruled by granting land and noble
titles to kinsmen and allies in exchange for loyalty and service. The
resulting political system, which saw China divided up by over one
hundred feudal states, is known as Zhou feudalism. During the Eastern
Zhou, this nobility became increasingly independent and fought with each
other for power and territory. A few declared themselves kings and
forged powerful militaries by gearing their kingdoms for war. In the
end, in 221 BCE, the state of Qin prevailed, initiating China's imperial
era. Also, in the midst of the dislocation caused by Eastern Zhou
instability, three of China's major philosophical traditions emerged:
Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism.

The short-lived Qin Dynasty was followed by the much longer lasting Han
Dynasty (202 BCE 220 CE). During the Han Dynasty, Confucianism was
adopted as the governing philosophy and also penetrated society, shaping
the Chinese worldview. The Han also became an empire, as borders were
expanded in all directions. During the reign of Emperor Wu (141--87
BCE), China extended control over parts of Korea, northern Vietnam, and
also much of Central Asia. The resulting stability and the productivity
of the economy spurred the development of the Silk Routes.

After the Han Dynasty fell, China was divided up by independent,
short-lived kingdoms until 589 CE, when the Sui Dynasty reunited most of
the territory once controlled by the Han. Thus, for four centuries,
during what is known as the Period of Division (220--589 CE), China was
politically unstable and racked by endemic warfare. Yet, in spite of the
violence, these centuries also saw vibrant cultural developments, as
Buddhism became an organized institutional religion reshaping the
spiritual landscape.

The Tang Dynasty (618--907 CE) was yet another long-lived one in Chinese
history. Tang rulers built an empire on the foundations of solid
political and legal institutions, agricultural policy, and a formidable
military. Also during the Tang Dynasty, East Asia first emerged as an
identifiable cultural sphere. By Tang times, kingdoms had already formed
on the Korean Peninsula and the main islands of Japan, but it was during
the Tang that ruling elites in both of these states made extensive
efforts to adapt components of the Chinese political, legal, and writing
system, as well as of Chinese culture, to their own societies. During
the seventh century CE, the Silla Dynasty unified the Korean Peninsula,
and the Yamato heavenly sovereigns unified much of Japan. Two other
unique East Asian civilizations had taken shape.

The last major dynasty surveyed was the Song Dynasty (960--1279 CE), one
that is notable for the challenges it faced from northern conquest
dynasties, its economic prosperity, and the civil service examination
system and the educated elite of scholar-officials it created. Also,
since foot binding developed during the Song, we considered the status
of women in Chinese society, where gender hierarchy was the norm.

The Song Dynasty ended with Mongol conquests in 1279 CE. The Mongol Yuan
Dynasty made China one part of a much larger Eurasian territorial
empire. Mongol rule lasted until 1368 CE, when native rebellions
overthrew a faltering Yuan state, initiating a new period in Chinese
history: the Ming Dynasty. This dynasty properly belongs to early modern
history.

## 5.2 INTRODUCTION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Sometime in the eighth century BCE, an aristocratic resident of the
Greek trading colony of Pithekoussai---located on the tiny island of
Ischia just off the coast of Naples in Italy---held a symposium at his
home. Most of what happened at the party stayed at the party, but what
we do know is that it must have been a good one. One of the guests,
presumably operating under the influence of his host's excellent wine,
took the liberty of scratching the following ditty onto one of his
host's fine exported ceramic wine cups: "I am the Cup of Nestor, good to
drink from. Whoever drinks from this cup, straightaway the desire of
beautifully-crowned Aphrodite will seize him."

While party pranks do not commonly make history, this one has: this
so-called Cup of Nestor is one of the earliest examples of writing in
the Greek alphabet, as well as the earliest known written reference to
the Homeric epics. Overall, this cup and the inscription on it exemplify
the mobility of the ancient Greeks and their borrowing of skills and
culture from others around the Mediterranean while, at the same time,
cultivating a set of values specific to themselves. After all, just like
the very residents of Pithekoussai, the cup had originally made the
journey all the way from the island of Euboea, off the coast of Athens,
to Pithekoussai, on the island of Ischia.

Furthermore, the new script, in which the daring guest wrote on the cup,
had just recently been borrowed and adapted by the Greeks from the
**Phoenicians**, a seafaring nation based in modern-day Lebanon. Indeed,
our clever poet wrote from right to left, just like the Phoenicians.
Finally, the poem mentions Nestor, one of the heroes of **Homer's**
***Iliad***, an epic about the **Trojan War** and a source of common
values that all Greeks held dear: military valor, competitive excellence
on both the battlefield and in all areas of everyday life, and a sense
of brotherhood that manifested itself most obviously in the shared
language of all the Greeks. That feeling of kinship facilitated
collaboration of all the Greeks in times of crisis from the mythical
Trojan War to the **Persian Wars (499--449 BCE)** and, finally, during
the Greeks' resistance against the Roman conquest.

## 5.5 GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

This chapter's title refers to the Greek World, rather than Greece.
While Greece is a unified country today, the territory of the
present-day country was not unified under one rule until the rise of the
Macedonians in the fourth century BCE. Instead, the basic unit of
organization in the period covered in this chapter was the ***polis***,
an independent city-state, which consisted of a walled city that
controlled and protected the farmland around it. Historians estimate
that close to 1,500 of these city-states dotted the ancient Greek
landscape.

Each of these ***poleis*** (plural form of *polis*) possessed its own
form of government, law-code, army, cults of patron gods, and overall
culture that set it apart from the other city-states. While the two most
famous *poleis*, **Athens** and **Sparta**, controlled vast territories
of farmland, most city-states were quite small, with a population of
just a few thousand citizens. Furthermore, the Greek world in antiquity
encompassed much more than present-day Greece, extending as far as Italy
in the West and the territories of modern-day Turkey and Ukraine in the
East.

The geography and topography of the Greek mainland and the Mediterranean
region surrounding it influenced the history of the Greek people in a
number of crucial ways. First, the mountainous nature of mainland
Greece, especially in the north, allowed different regions to remain
somewhat isolated. The most isolated of all, Thessaly and Macedon, were
viewed as uncivilized barbarians by the rest of the Greeks in the
Archaic and Classical Periods (one oft-mentioned example of their
"barbarism" in Greek literature is that they drank their wine
undiluted!) and largely kept to themselves until their rise to military
prominence in the mid-fourth century BCE. The mountains throughout the
northern portion of mainland Greece, in addition to isolating regions
from each other and promoting regional culture, also provided tactical
defenses in the face of external attacks. Most famously, the Persians
learned the hard way about the challenges of navigating the Greek
landscape during the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BCE as
part of the Persian Wars. Indeed, the story of the 300 Spartans who
fought to the death at the **Battle of Thermopylae** addresses the
challenge of the Persian army trying to cross the mountains to the north
of Attica in order to invade Athens by land.

The **Isthmus**, a narrow strip of land controlled by Corinth, played a
similar role in separating mainland Greece from the large peninsula of
the **Peloponnese**. An inland city in southern Peloponnese, Sparta
conquered Messenia, its surrounding region, early in its history and
extended political control over much of the peninsula by the early fifth
century BCE. Unless the interests of Sparta herself were directly
involved, Sparta practiced a policy of isolation and limited military
intervention in other city-states affairs and wars, a practice enabled
due to Sparta's far southern location in Peloponnese.

No less influential for the history of the Greek city-states than the
topographical features were the resources that the land in different
regions provided for agriculture and manufacturing. Mainland Greece was
notoriously unsuitable for agriculture. Growing the grain staples wheat
and barley in the rocky and clay-filled soil of Athens was especially
difficult, while the mountainous regions across the entire mainland were
optimal for herding, rather than agriculture. One notable exception,
however, were olive trees, which grew abundantly. Olive oil, as a
result, was ubiquitously used for eating, bathing, and lamps and even as
currency or prize for victors in athletic games. In addition, early on
in their history, the inhabitants of Attica and Corinth found a way to
profit from the clay in their soil by developing advanced ceramic
pot-making and decorating techniques. Remains of Athenian and Corinthian
wares have been found at archaeological sites all over the
Mediterranean, attesting to their popularity abroad.

But the topography and geography of mainland Greece and the Peloponnese
only tell us a part of the story. The Aegean Sea is filled with islands,
some of which remained autonomous, but most came under the control of
the Athenian maritime empire in the fifth century BCE. In addition, the
Greek colonization movement of the seventh and sixth centuries BCE
resulted in the foundation of numerous Greek city-states in Asia Minor
(modern-day Turkey), Magna Graecia (southern Italy), Sicily, and the
Black Sea littoral.

The history of the Greek world from its earliest settlements to the
Roman conquest, therefore, is inextricably tied together with the
history of the Mediterranean as a whole. And since the Greek areas of
influence overlapped with those controlled by the Phoenicians, Persians,
and eventually, the Romans, interactions, often warlike, were
unavoidable as well. As the modern historians Peregrine Horden and
Nicholas Purcell noted, the Mediterranean was "the Corrupting
Sea"[^\[1\]^](#chapter-005-unknown-3.xhtml_footnote-366-1 "Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000)."){#chapter-005-unknown-3.xhtml_return-footnote-366-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"} whose inhabitants were like frogs
around the pond, watching each other and borrowing each other's cultural
and technological achievements. As this chapter and the next will show,
the Greeks and the Romans were the farthest-leaping frogs of all.

## 5.6 PERIODS OF GREEK HISTORY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Historians today separate Greek history into particular periods, which
shared specific features throughout the Greek world:

The **Bronze Age** (c. 3,300--1,150 BCE)---a period characterized by the
use of bronze tools and weapons. In addition, two particular periods
during the Bronze Age are crucial in the development of early Greece:
the Minoan Age on the island of **Crete** (c. 2,000--1,450 BCE) and the
Mycenean period on mainland Greece (c. 1,600--1,100 BCE), both of them
characterized by massive palaces, remnants of which still proudly stand
today. The Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations had writing (dubbed
**Linear A** and **Linear B**, respectively), which they used for
keeping lists and palace inventories.

The **Dark Ages** (c. 1,100--700 BCE)---a period that is "dark" from the
archaeological perspective, which means that the monumental palaces of
the Mycenean period disappear, and the archaeological record reveals a
general poverty and loss of culture throughout the Greek world. For
instance, the Linear A and Linear B writing systems disappear. The
Greeks do not rediscover writing until the invention of the Greek
alphabet at the end of the Dark Ages or the early Archaic Period.

**Archaic Period** (c. 700--480 BCE)---the earliest period for which
written evidence survives; this is the age of the rise of the Greek
city-states, colonization, and the Persian Wars.

**Classical Period** (c. 480--323 BCE)---the period from the end of the
Persian Wars to the death of **Alexander the Great**. One of the most
important events during this period is the Peloponnesian War (431--404
BCE), which pitted Athens against Sparta and forced all other Greek
city-states to choose to join one side or the other. This period ends
with the death of Alexander the Great, who had unified the Greek world
into a large kingdom with himself at its helm.

**Hellenistic Period** (323--146 BCE)---the period from the death of
Alexander to the Roman conquest of Greece; this is the age of the
Hellenistic monarchies ruling over territories previously conquered by
Alexander and his generals. Some historians end this period in 30 BCE,
with the death of **Cleopatra VII**, the last surviving ruler of Egypt
who was a descendant of one of Alexander's generals.

The rest of this chapter will be devoted to examining each of these
periods in greater detail, covering chief political, military, and
cultural developments.

## 5.7 METHODOLOGY: SOURCES AND PROBLEM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Before launching into the story of the early Greek world, it is
important to consider the methodology that Greek historians utilize. In
other words, how do we know what we know about the Greek world? Modern
scholars of ancient history are notoriously obsessed with evaluating
their primary sources critically, and with good reason. Studying Greek
history, especially in its earliest periods, is like putting together a
puzzle, most of whose pieces are missing, and some pieces from another
puzzle have also been added in for good measure. Greek history requires
careful consideration of a wide range of sources, which fall into two
broad categories: literary sources (including both fiction and
non-fiction) and material culture. The job of the historian, then, is to
reconstruct the story of the Greek people using these very different
sources.

While historians of the modern world rely on such archival sources as
newspapers, magazines, and personal diaries and correspondence of
individuals and groups, historians of the ancient world must use every
available source to reconstruct the world in which their subject
dwelled. Literary sources, such as epics, lyric poetry, and drama, may
seem strange for historians to use, as they do not necessarily describe
specific historical events. Yet, as in the case of other early
civilizations, such sources are a crucial window into the culture and
values of the people who produced them.

The earliest literary sources for Greek history are the Homeric epics
***Iliad*** and *Odyssey*. They are, however, one of the most
challenging sources to interpret, with one modern historian dubbing them
a "historian's headache."
[^\[2\]^](#chapter-005-unknown-3.xhtml_footnote-366-2 "Kurt Raaflaub, “A Historian’s Headache: How to Read ‘Homeric Society’?” in N. Fisher and H. Van wees eds., Archaic Greece: New Approaches and New Evidence (London: Duckworth: 1998)"){#chapter-005-unknown-3.xhtml_return-footnote-366-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"}. Composed orally before the existence
of the Greek alphabet, the epics were not written down until sometime in
the sixth century BCE. The epics most likely do not reflect the society
of any particular Greek city-state in any one period but rather consist
of an amalgam of features from the Bronze Age to the early Archaic
Period. Their value for historians, as a result, rests more on their
impact on subsequent Greek culture rather than on their providing
information about Bronze Age Greeks. More than any other literary
source, the Homeric epics influenced the mentality of the Greeks in
thinking about war and what it means to be a hero.

Several genres of non-fiction survive as well, allowing historians to
study specific events and problems in the history of the Greek world,
and especially Athens. The works of three major historians survive from
Classical Athens. **Herodotus**, dubbed the Father of History, wrote the
*Histories* about the Persian Wars in the mid-fifth century BCE.
**Thucydides**, an Athenian general in the Peloponnesian War, wrote a
history of the Peloponnesian War over the course of the war (431--404
BCE). Finally, Xenophon wrote a history of the end of the Peloponnesian
War, starting with 411 BCE, where Thucydides' work ended, and into the
fourth century. In addition to the works of the historians,
philosophical treatises---most notably, those of **Plato** and
**Aristotle**---provide crucial insight into the political thought,
moral values, and perceptions of the world in the late fifth and fourth
centuries BCE. The approximately 100 surviving courtroom speeches from
the same period likewise provide us with a window into the Athenian
legal system. Finally, the Hippocratic corpus, a series of medical
treatises and physicians' journals from the Classical Period, help us to
understand the Greeks' views of the human body and diseases. But in
addition to the geographical restrictions of these sources, which
largely document Athens, it is also important to note two other key
limitations of the available evidence. First, virtually all of the
literary sources were written by men and provide very little evidence of
the lives and perspectives of women in the Greek world, except as seen
through the eyes of men. Second, most of the authors were wealthy and
socially prominent individuals; thus, their perspective does not reflect
that of less affluent citizens and slaves.,

Archaeological evidence thankfully allows historians to fill some of the
gaps in the literary evidence. Material finds, such as pottery remains,
in different sites across the Mediterranean also allow historians to map
trading routes---for instance, Figures 5.1 and 5.2 show vases that were
made in Euboea and Corinth, respectively, but were found in Greek
colonies in Italy. In addition, images on pottery provide information
about stories and myths that have entered popular culture and that
sometimes reflect further aspects of everyday life. For instance, the
prevalence of images of women gathering at public fountains on Athenian
***hydriae*** (water pots) from the late sixth century BCE shows the
importance of the public fountains for the social life of women in
Athens in the period.

Finally, written archaeological sources, such as inscriptions on stone
or pottery shards from all over the Greek world and papyri from
Hellenistic Egypt, are the equivalent of documentary archives from the
ancient world. The evidence from epigraphy (inscriptions) includes laws
that were written on large stones and set up in public, such as the
monumental law-code from Gortyn, Crete, and lists of war-dead, as well
as private tomb inscriptions.

Papyri, on the other hand, include such private documents as prenuptial
agreements (among the strangest are prenuptial documents for
brother-sister marriages---legal in Egypt but nowhere else in the Greek
world), divorce documents, loans, and village police reports (cattle
theft appears to have been a serious problem in the Faiyum in the
Hellenistic Period!).

Taken together, the literary and archaeological sources allow the
historian to complete much more of the puzzle than would have been
possible with just one of these types of sources. Still, significant
gaps in knowledge remain nevertheless and are, perhaps, one of the joys
of studying ancient history: the historian gets to play the part of a
sleuth, attempting to reconstruct the history of events based on just a
few available clues.

## 5.8 FROM MYTHOLOGY TO HISTORY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The terms "mythology" and "history" may seem, by modern definitions, to
be antithetical. After all, mythology refers to stories that are clearly
false, of long-forgotten gods and heroes and their miraculous feats.
History, on the other hand, refers to actual events that involved real
people. And yet, the idea that the two are opposites would have seemed
baffling to a typical resident of the ancient Mediterranean world.
Rather, gods and myths were part of everyday life, and historical events
could become subsumed by myths just as easily as myths could become a
part of history. For instance, Gilgamesh, the hero of the Sumerian *Epic
of Gilgamesh*, was a real king of Uruk, yet he also became the hero of
the epic. Each Greek city-state, in particular, had a foundation myth
describing its origins as well as its own patron gods and goddesses.

Yet, while the Greeks saw mythology and history as related concepts and
sometimes as two sides of the same coin, one specific mythical event
marked, in the eyes of the earliest known Greek historians, the
beginning of the story of Greek-speaking peoples. That event was the
Trojan War.

### 5.8.1 Homer and the Trojan War {.import-Header3}

It is telling that the two earliest Greek historians---Herodotus,
writing in the mid-fifth century BCE, and Thucydides, writing in the
last third of the fifth century BCE---began their respective histories
with the Trojan War, each treating it as a historical event. The Homeric
epics *Iliad* and *Odyssey* portray the war as an organized attack of a
unified Greek army against Troy, a city in Asia Minor (see map 5.2). The
instigating offense? The Trojan prince Paris kidnapped Helen, the most
beautiful woman in the world, from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta.
This offense, interpreted as a slight to Menelaus' honor, prompted
Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and Menelaus' brother, to raise an army from
the entire Greek world and sail to Troy. The mythical tradition had it
that after a brutal ten-year siege, the Greeks resorted to a trick: they
presented the Trojans with a hollow wooden horse filled with armed
soldiers. The Trojans tragically accepted the gift, ostensibly intended
as a dedication to the goddess Athena. That same night, the armed
contingent emerged from the horse, and the city finally fell to the
Greeks. Picking up the story ten years after the end of the Trojan War,
the *Odyssey* then told the story of Odysseus' struggles to return home
after the war and the changes that reverberated throughout the Greek
world after the fall of Troy.

The Homeric epics were the foundation of Greek education in the Archaic
and Classical Periods and, as such, are a historian's best source of
pan-Hellenic values. A major theme throughout both epics is personal
honor, which Homeric heroes value more than the collective cause.
Ultimately, Achilles has to make a choice: he can live a long life and
die unknown, or he can die in battle young and have everlasting glory,
kleos. Achilles' selection of the second option made him the inspiration
for such historical Greek warriors and generals as Alexander the Great,
who brought his scroll copy of the *Iliad* with him on all campaigns.
Finally, the presence of the gods in the background of the Trojan War
shows the Greeks' belief that the gods were everywhere and acted in the
lives of mortals. These gods could be powerful benefactors and patrons
of individuals who respected them and sought their favor or vicious
enemies, bent on destruction. It is important to note that while the
Homeric epics influenced Greek values from the Archaic Period on, they
do not reflect the reality of the Greek world in any one period.
Furthermore, they were not composed by the single poet often credited
with the legendary works, **Homer**; indeed, it is possible that Homer
never existed. Because the epics were composed orally by multiple bards
over the period of several hundred years, they combine details about
technological and other aspects of the Bronze Age with those of the Dark
Ages and even the early Archaic Age.

### 5.8.2 Greece in the Bronze Age and the Dark Ages

While there were people living in mainland Greece already in the
Neolithic Period, historians typically begin the study of the Greeks as
a unique civilization in the Bronze Age, with the **Minoans**. The first
literate civilization in Europe, the Minoans were a palace civilization
that flourished on the island of **Crete** c. 2,000--1,450 BCE.

As befits island-dwellers, they were traders and seafarers; indeed, the
Greek historian Thucydides credits them with being the first Greeks to
sail on ships. Sir Arthur Evans, the archaeologist who first excavated
Crete in the early 1900s, dubbed them Minoans, after the mythical Cretan
king Minos who was best known for building a labyrinth to house the
Minotaur, a monster that was half-man, half-bull. Bulls appear
everywhere in surviving Minoan art, suggesting that they indeed held a
prominent place in Minoan mythology and religion.

Four major palace sites survive on Crete. The most significant of them,
Knossos, has been restored and reconstructed for the benefit of modern
tourists.

</figure>

Historians hypothesize that the palaces were the homes of local rulers,
who ruled and protected the surrounding farmland. The palaces seem to
have kept records in two different writing systems, the earliest known
in Europe: the Cretan hieroglyphic and **Linear A** scripts.
Unfortunately, neither of these systems has been deciphered, but it is
likely that these were palace inventories and records pertaining to
trade. The palaces had no surrounding walls, suggesting that the Cretans
maintained peace with each other and felt safe from outside attacks,
since they lived on an island. This sense of security proved to be a
mistake, as around 1,450 BCE, the palaces were violently destroyed by
invaders, possibly the **Mycenaeans** who arrived from mainland Greece.
Recent discoveries also suggest that at least some of the destruction
may have been the result of tsunamis which accompanied the Santorini/
Thera volcanic eruption in the 1600s BCE.

</figure>

The Mycenaeans, similar to the Minoans, were a palace civilization.
Flourishing on mainland Greece c. 1,600--1,100 BCE, they received their
name from Mycenae, the most elaborate surviving palace and the mythical
home of Agamemnon, the commander-in-chief of the Greek army in the
Trojan War. The archaeological excavations of graves in Mycenae reveal a
prosperous civilization that produced elaborate pottery, bronze weapons
and tools, and extravagant jewelry and other objects made of precious
metals and gems. One of the most famous finds is the so-called **"Mask
of Agamemnon**," a burial mask with which one aristocrat was buried,
made of hammered gold. The Mycenaeans also kept palace records in a
syllabic script, known as **Linear B**. Related to the Cretan Linear A
script, Linear B, however, has been deciphered and identified as Greek.

</figure>

Archaeological evidence also shows that sometime in the 1,200s BCE, the
Mycenaean palaces suffered a series of attacks and were gradually
abandoned over the next century. The period that begins around 1,000 BCE
is known as the "Dark Ages" because of the notable decline, in contrast
with the preceding period. The Mycenaean Linear B script disappears, and
archaeological evidence shows a poorer Greece with a decline in material
wealth and life expectancy. Some contact, however, must have remained
with the rest of the Mediterranean, as shown by the emergence of the
Greek alphabet, adapted from the Phoenician writing system towards the
end of the Dark Ages or early in the Archaic Period.

## 5.9 ARCHAIC GREECE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The story of the Greek world in the Dark Ages could mostly be described
as a story of fragmentation. With a few exceptions, individual sites had
limited contact with each other. The Archaic Period, however, appears to
have been a time of growing contacts and connections between different
parts of mainland Greece. Furthermore, it was a time of expansion, as
the establishment of overseas colonies and cities brought the Greeks to
Italy and Sicily in the West and Asia Minor and the Black Sea littoral
in the East. Furthermore, while Greeks in the Archaic Period saw
themselves as citizens of individual city-states, this period also
witnessed the rise of a **Pan-Hellenic** identity, as all Greeks saw
themselves connected by virtue of their common language, religion, and
Homeric values. This Pan-Hellenic identity was ultimately cemented
during the Persian Wars: two invasions of Greece by the Persian Empire
at the end of the Archaic Period.

### 5.9.1 Rise of the Hoplite Phalanx and the Polis {.import-Header3}

A Corinthian vase, known today as the Chigi Vase, made in the
mid-seventh century BCE, presents a tantalizing glimpse of the changing
times from the Dark Ages to the Archaic Period. Taking up much of the
decorated space on the vase is a battle scene. Two armies of warriors
with round shields, helmets, and spears are facing each other and appear
to be marching in formation towards each other in preparation for
attack.

Modern scholars largely consider the vase to be the earliest artistic
portrayal of the **hoplite phalanx**, a new way of fighting that spread
around the Greek world in the early Archaic Age and that coincided with
the rise of another key institution for subsequent Greek history: the
***polis***, or city-state. From the early Archaic Period to the
conquest of the Greek world by Philip and Alexander in the late fourth
century BCE, the *polis* was the central unit of organization in the
Greek world.

While warfare in the *Iliad* consisted largely of duels between
individual heroes, the hoplite phalanx was a new mode of fighting that
did not rely on the skill of individuals. Rather, it required all
soldiers in the line to work together as a whole. Armed in the same way
with a helmet, a spear, and the round shield---the *hoplon*, which gave
the hoplites their name---the soldiers were arranged in rows, possibly
as much as seven deep. Each soldier carried his shield on his left arm,
protecting the left side of his own body and the right side of his
comrade to the left. Working together as one, then, the phalanx would
execute the *othismos* (a mass shove) during battle, with the goal of
shoving the enemy phalanx off the battlefield.

Historians do not know which came into existence first, the phalanx or
the *polis*, but the two clearly reflect a similar ideology. In fact,
the phalanx could be seen as a microcosm of the *polis*, exemplifying
the chief values of the *polis* on a small scale. Each *polis* was a
fully self-sufficient unit of organization, with its own laws,
definition of citizenship, government, army, economy, and local cults.
Regardless of the differences between the many *poleis* in matters of
citizenship, government, and law, one key similarity is clear: the
survival of the *polis* depended on the dedication of all its citizens
to the collective well-being of the city-state. This dedication included
service in the phalanx. As a result, citizenship in most Greek
city-states was closely connected to military service, and women were
excluded from citizenship. Furthermore, since hoplites had to provide
their own armor, these citizen-militias effectively consisted of
landowners. This is not to say, though, that the poorer citizens were
entirely excluded from serving their city. One example of a way in which
they may have participated even in the phalanx appears on the Chigi
Vase. Marching between two lines of warriors is an unarmed man playing a
double-reed flute (seen on the right end of the top band in Figure
5.10). Since the success of the phalanx depended on marching together in
step, the flute player's music would have been essential to ensure that
everyone kept the same tempo during the march.

### 5.9.2 Greek Religion {.import-Header3}

One theory modern scholars have proposed for the rise of the *polis*
connects the locations of the city-states to known cult sites. The
theory argues that the Greeks of the Archaic Period built city-states
around these precincts of various gods in order to live closer to them
and protect them. While impossible to know for sure if this theory or
any other regarding the rise of the polis is true, the building of
temples in cities during the Archaic Period shows the increasing
emphasis that the *poleis* were placing on religion.

It is important to note that Greek religion seems to have been, at least
to some extent, an element of continuity from the Bronze Age to the
Archaic Period and beyond. The important role that the gods play in the
Homeric epics attests to their prominence in the oral tradition, going
back to the Dark Ages. Furthermore, names of the following major gods
worshipped in the Archaic Period and beyond were found on the deciphered
Linear B tablets: Zeus, king of the gods and god of weather, associated
with the thunderbolt; Hera, Zeus' wife and patroness of childbirth;
Poseidon, god of the sea; Hermes, messenger god and patron of thieves
and merchants; Athena, goddess of war and wisdom and patroness of
women's crafts; Ares, god of war; Dionysus, god of wine; and the twins
Apollo, god of the sun and both god of the plague and a healer, and
Artemis, goddess of the hunt and the moon. All of these gods continued
to be the major divinities in Greek religion for its duration, and many
of them were worshipped as patron gods of individual cities, such as
Artemis at Sparta and Athena at Athens.

While many local cults of even major gods were truly local in appeal, a
few local cults achieved truly Pan-Hellenic appeal. Drawing visitors
from all over the Greek world, these Pan-Hellenic cults were seen as
belonging equally to all the Greeks. One of the most famous examples is
the cult of Asclepius at Epidaurus. Asclepius, son of Apollo, was a
healer god, and his shrine at Epidaurus attracted the pilgrims from all
over the Greek world. Visitors suffering from illness practiced
incubation---that is, spending the night in the temple---in the hopes of
receiving a vision in their dreams suggesting a cure. In gratitude for
the god's healing, some pilgrims dedicated casts of their healed body
parts. Archaeological findings include a plentitude of ears, noses,
arms, and feet. Starting out as local cults, several religious festivals
that included athletic competitions as part of the celebration also
achieved Pan-Hellenic prominence during the Archaic Period. The most
influential of these were the **Olympic Games**. Beginning in 776 BCE,
the Olympic Games were held in Olympia every four years in honor of
Zeus; they drew competitors from all over the Greek world and even
Persia. The Pan-Hellenic appeal of the Olympics is signified by the
impact that these games had on Greek politics: for instance, a truce was
in effect throughout the Greek world for the duration of each Olympics.
In addition, the Olympics provided a Pan-Hellenic system of dating
events by Olympiads or four-year cycles.

</figure>

Finally, perhaps the most politically influential of the Pan-Hellenic
cults was the oracle of Apollo at **Delphi**, established sometime in
the eighth century BCE. Available for consultation only nine days a
year, the oracle spoke responses to the questions asked by inquirers
through a priestess, named the Pythia. The Pythia's responses came in
the form of poetry and were notoriously difficult to interpret.
Nevertheless, city-states and major rulers throughout the Greek world
considered it essential to consult the oracle before embarking on any
major endeavor, such as war or founding a colony.

### 5.9.3 Maritime Trade and Colonization {.import-Header3}

The historian Herodotus records that sometime c. 630 BCE, the king of
the small island of Thera traveled to Delphi to offer a sacrifice and
consult the oracle on a few minor points. To his surprise, the oracle's
response had nothing to do with his queries. Instead, the Pythia
directed him to found a colony in Libya, North Africa. Having never
heard of Libya, the king ignored the advice. A seven-year drought
ensued, and the Therans felt compelled to consult the oracle again.
Receiving the same response as before, they finally sent out a group of
colonists who eventually founded the city of Cyrene.

While this story may sound absurd, it is similar to other foundation
stories of Greek colonies and emphasizes the importance of the Delphic
oracle. At the same time, though, this story still leaves open the
question of motive: why did so many Greek city-states of the Archaic
Period send out colonies to other parts of the Greek world? Archaeology
and foundation legends, such as those recorded by Herodotus, suggest two
chief reasons: population pressures, along with a shortage of productive
farmland in the cities on mainland Greece, and increased ease of trade
that colonies abroad facilitated. In addition to resolving these two
problems, however, the colonies also had the unforeseen impact of
increasing interactions of the Greeks with the larger Mediterranean
world and the ancient Near East. These interactions are visible, for
instance, in the so-called Orientalizing style of art in the Archaic
Period, a style the Greeks borrowed from the Middle East and Egypt.

As section 5.9.5 will show, however, the presence of Greek colonies in
Asia Minor also played a major role in bringing about the Greco-Persian
Wars.

### 5.9.4. Aristocracy, Democracy, and Tyranny in Archaic Greece {.import-Header3}

Later Greek historians, including Herodotus and Thucydides, noted a
certain trend in the trajectory of the history of most Greek *poleis*:
most city-states started out with a monarchical or quasi-monarchical
government. Over time, the people gained greater representation, and an
assembly of all citizens had at least some degree of political
power---although some degree of strife typically materialized between
the aristocrats and the poorer elements. Taking advantage of such civic
conflicts, **tyrants** came to power in most city-states for a brief
period before the people banded together and drove them out, thenceforth
replacing them with a more popular form of government. Many modern
historians are skeptical about some of the stories that the Greek
historians tell about origins of some *poleis*; for instance, it is
questionable whether the earliest Thebans truly were born from dragon
teeth. Similarly, the stories about some of the Archaic tyrants seem to
belong more to the realm of legend than history. Nevertheless, the
preservation of stories about tyrants in early oral tradition suggests
that city-states likely went through periods of turmoil and change in
their form of government before developing a more stable constitution.
Furthermore, this line of development accurately describes the early
history of Athens, the best-documented *polis*.

In the early Archaic Period, Athens largely had an aristocratic
constitution. Widespread debt-slavery, however, caused significant civic
strife in the city and led to the appointment of **Solon** as lawgiver
for the year 594/3 BCE, specifically for the purpose of reforming the
laws. Solon created a more democratic constitution and also left poetry
documenting justifications for his reforms---and different citizens'
reactions to them. Most controversial of all, Solon instituted a
one-time debt-forgiveness, *seisachtheia,* which literally means
"shaking off." He proceeded to divide all citizens into five classes
based on income, assigning a level of political participation and
responsibility commensurate with each class. Shortly after Solon's
reforms, a tyrant, Peisistratus, illegally seized control of Athens and
remained in power off and on from 561 to 527 BCE. Peisistratus seems to
have been a reasonably popular ruler who had the support of a
significant portion of the Athenian population. His two sons, Hippias
and Hipparchus, however, appear to have been less well-liked. Two men,
Harmodius and Aristogeiton, assassinated Hipparchus in 514 BCE; then in
508 BCE, the Athenians, with the help of a Spartan army, permanently
drove out Hippias. In subsequent Athenian history, Harmodius and
Aristogeiton were considered heroes of the democracy and celebrated as
tyrannicides.

<figcaption>Figure 5.13 | The structure of the Classical Athenian
democracy, fourth century BCE Author: User “Mathieugp” Source: Wikimedia

</figure>

Immediately following the expulsion of Hippias, Athens underwent a
second round of democratic reforms, led by **Cleisthenes**. The
Cleisthenic constitution remained in effect, with few changes, until the
Macedonian conquest of Athens in the fourth century BCE and is
considered to be the Classical **Athenian democracy**, or *demokratia*.
Central to the democracy was the participation of all citizens, or the
"**demos**," in two types of institutions: the *ekklesia*, an assembly
of all citizens, which functioned as the chief deliberative body of the
city; and the law-courts, to which citizens were assigned by lot as
jurors. Two chief offices, the generals and the archos, ruled over the
city and were appointed for one-year terms. Ten generals were elected
annually by the *ekklesia* for the purpose of leading the Athenian
military forces. Finally, the leading political office each year, the
nine archons, were appointed by lot from all eligible citizens. While
this notion of appointing the top political leaders by lot may seem
surprising, it exemplifies the Athenians' pride in their democracy and
their desire to believe that, in theory at least, all Athenian citizens
were equally valuable and capable of leading their city-state.

Developing in a very different manner from Athens, Sparta was seen by
other Greek *poleis* as a very different sort of city from the rest.
Ruled from an early period by two kings---one from each of the two royal
houses that ruled jointly---Sparta was a true oligarchy, in which the
power rested in its *gerousia*, a council of thirty elders, whose number
included the two kings. While an assembly of all citizens existed as
well, its powers were much more limited than were those of the Athenian
assembly. Because of much more restrictive citizenship rules, the
Spartan assembly of citizens was a more selective body, as the **Spartan
Constitution** (Figure 5.14) illustrates.

</figure>

A crucial moment in Spartan history was the city's conquest of the
nearby region of Messenia in the eighth century BCE. The Spartans
annexed the Messenian territory to their own and made the Messenians
**helots**. While the helots could not be bought or sold, they were
permanently tied to the land in a status akin to medieval European serfs
and responsible for farming the land. The availability of helot labor,
and as a result a stable food supply, allowed the Spartans from that
point on to focus their attention on military training. This focus
transformed Sparta into the ultimate military state in the Greek world,
widely respected by the other Greek *poleis* for its military prowess.
Other Greeks were fascinated by such Spartan practices as the communal
bringing up of all children apart from their parents and the requirement
that all Spartan girls and women, as well as boys and men, maintain a
strict regimen of exercise and training.

But while Athens and Sparta sound like each other's diametrical
opposites, the practices of both *poleis* ultimately derived from the
same belief that all city-states held: that in order to ensure their
city's survival, the citizens must place their city-state's interests
above their own. A democracy simply approached this goal with a
different view of the qualifications of its citizens than did an
oligarchy.

Women had an ambiguous status in the Greek *poleis*. In connection with
Greek city-states' definitions of citizenship, only children of legally
married and freeborn citizen parents could be citizens in most
city-states. While not full-fledged citizens themselves, women produced
citizens. Comparing the two *poleis* demonstrate that both view women as
the mothers of citizens but differ in adultery laws. In Athens, if a
husband caught his wife with an adulterer in his home, the law allowed
the husband to kill said adulterer on the spot. The adultery law was so
harsh precisely because adultery put into question the citizenship
status of potential children, thereby depriving the city of future
citizens. By contrast, Spartan law allowed an unmarried man who wanted
offspring to sleep with the wife of another man, with the latter's
consent, specifically for the purpose of producing children. This law
reflects the importance that Sparta placed on producing strong future
soldiers as well as the communal attitude of the city towards family and
citizenship.

### 5.9.5 The Persian Wars {.import-Header3}

Despite casting their net far and wide in founding colonies, the Greeks
seem to have remained in a state of relatively peaceful coexistence with
the rest of their Mediterranean neighbors until the sixth century BCE.
In the mid-sixth century BCE, Cyrus, an ambitious king of Persia,
embarked on a swift program of expansion, ultimately consolidating under
his rule the largest empire of the ancient world and earning for himself
the title "**Cyrus the Great**."

Cyrus' **Achaemenid Empire** bordered the area of Asia Minor that had
been previously colonized by the Greeks. This expansion of the Persian
Empire brought the Persians into direct conflict with the Greeks and
became the origin of the Greco-Persian Wars, the greatest military
conflict the Greek world had known up until that point.

Over the second half of the sixth century, the Persians had taken over
the region of Asia Minor, also known as Ionia, installing as rulers of
these Greek city-states tyrants loyal to Persia. In 499 BCE, however,
the Greek city-states in Asia Minor joined forces to rebel against the
Persian rule. Athens and Eretria sent military support for this Ionian
Revolt, and the rebelling forces marched on the Persian capital of
Sardis and burned it in 498 BCE before the revolt was finally subdued by
the Persians in 493 BCE.

Seeking revenge on Athens and Eretria, the Persian king **Darius**
launched an expedition in 490 BCE. Darius' forces captured Eretria in
mid-summer, destroyed the city, and enslaved its inhabitants. Sailing a
short distance across the bay, the Persian army then landed at Marathon.
The worried Athenians sent a plea for help to Sparta. The Spartans, in
the middle of a religious festival, refused to help. So, on September
12, 490 BCE, the Athenians, with only a small force of Plataeans
helping, faced the much larger Persian army in the **Battle of
Marathon**. The decisive Athenian victory showed the superiority of the
Greek hoplite phalanx and marked the end of the first Persian invasion
of Greece. Furthermore, the victory at Marathon, which remained a point
of pride for the Athenians for centuries after, demonstrated to the rest
of the Greeks that Sparta was not the only great military power in
Greece.

</figure>

Darius died in 486 BCE, having never realized his dream of revenge
against the Greeks. His son, **Xerxes**, however, continued his father's
plans and launched in 480 BCE a second invasion of Greece, with an army
so large that, as the historian Herodotus claims, it drank entire rivers
dry on its march. The Greek world reacted in a much more organized
fashion to this second invasion than it did to the first. Led by Athens
and Sparta, some seventy Greek *poleis* formed a sworn alliance to fight
together against the Persians. This alliance, the first of its kind,
proved to be the key to defeating the Persians, as it allowed the allies
to split forces strategically in order to guard against Persian attack
by both land and sea. The few Greek city-states who declared loyalty to
the Persian Empire instead---most notably, Thebes---were seen as
traitors for centuries to come by the rest of the Greeks.

Marching through mainland Greece from the north, the Persians first
confronted the Spartans at the **Battle of Thermopylae**, a narrow
mountain pass that stood in the way of the Persians' accessing any point
south. In this now-legendary battle, 300 Spartans, led by their king
Leonidas, successfully defended the pass for two days before being
betrayed by a local who showed a roundabout route to the Persians. The
Persians then were able to outflank the Spartans and kill them to the
last man. This battle, although a loss for the Greeks, bought crucial
time for the rest of the Greek forces in preparing to face the Persians.
It is also important to note that although the Spartans were considered
to be the heroes of Thermopylae, they were also accompanied by small
contingents from several other Greek city-states in this endeavor.

The victory at Thermopylae fulfilled the old dream of Darius, as it
allowed access to Athens for the Persians. The Athenian statesman
Themistocles, however, had ordered a full evacuation of the city in
advance of the Persian attack through an unusual interpretation of a
Delphic oracle stating that wooden walls will save Athens. Taking the
oracle to mean that the wooden walls in question were ships,
Themistocles built a massive fleet which he used to send all of the
city's inhabitants to safety. His gamble proved to be successful, and
the Persians captured and burned a mostly empty city.

The Athenians proceeded to defeat the Persian fleet at the **Battle of
Salamis**, off the coast of Athens, thus shortly before winter turning
the tide of the war in favor of the Greeks. The Persian fleet had the
numerical advantage, but its ships were larger and did not fare well in
the Aegean Sea, where the smaller Greek ships were much more
maneuverable around the many small islands and shallow waters. Finally,
in June of 479 BCE, the Greek forces were able to strike the two final
blows, defeating the Persian land and sea forces on the same day in the
Battle of Plataea on land and the Battle of Mycale on the sea. The
victory at Mycale also resulted in a second Ionian Revolt, which this
time ended in a victory for the Greek city-states in Asia Minor. Xerxes
was left to sail home to his diminished empire.

It is difficult to overestimate the impact of the Persian Wars on
subsequent Greek history. Seen by historians as the end-point of the
Archaic Period, the Persian Wars cemented Pan-Hellenic identity, as they
saw cooperation on an unprecedented scale among the Greek city-states.
In addition, the Persian Wars showed the Greek military superiority over
the Persians on both land and sea, at least in the Greek localities.
Finally, the wars showed Athens in a new light to the rest of the
Greeks. As the winners of Marathon in the first invasion and the leaders
of the navy during the second invasion, the Athenians emerged from the
wars as the rivals of Sparta for military prestige among the Greeks.
This last point, in particular, proved to be the most influential for
Greek history in the subsequent period.

## 5.10 THE CLASSICAL PERIOD {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

So far, the story of the Greek world in this chapter has proceeded from
a narrative of the fragmented Greek world in the Dark Ages to the
emergence and solidification of a Pan-Hellenic identity in the Archaic
Period. The story of the Greeks in the Classical Period, by contrast, is
best described as the question of who would lead the Greek world. First,
Athens and Sparta spent much of the fifth century BCE battling each
other for control of the Greek world. Ultimately, this internal conflict
during the Classical Period resulted with the Greek world under the
control of a power that was virtually unknown to the Greeks at the
beginning of the fifth century BCE: Macedon.

### 5.10.1 From the Delian League to the Athenian Empire {.import-Header3}

In 478 BCE, barely a year after the end of the Persian Wars, a group of
Greek city-states, mainly those located in Ionia and on the island
between mainland Greece and Ionia, founded the **Delian League**, with
the aim of continuing to protect the Greeks in Ionia from Persian
attacks. Led by Athens, the league first met on the tiny island of
Delos. According to Greek mythology, the twin gods Apollo and Artemis
were born on Delos. As a result, the island was considered sacred ground
and, as such, was a fitting neutral headquarters for the new alliance.
The league allowed member states the option of either contributing a tax
(an option that most members selected) or contributing ships for the
league's navy. The treasury of the league, where the taxes paid by
members were deposited, was housed on Delos.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px">

</figure>

Over the next twenty years, the Delian League gradually transformed from
a loose alliance of states led by Athens to a more formal entity. The
League's Athenian leadership, in the meanwhile, grew to be that of an
imperial leader. The few members who tried to secede from the League,
such as the island of Naxos, quickly learned that doing so was not an
option, as the revolt was violently subdued. Finally, in 454 BCE, the
treasury of the Delian League moved to Athens. That moment marked the
transformation of the Delian League into the Athenian Empire.

Since the Athenians publicly inscribed each year the one-sixtieth
portion of the tribute that they dedicated to Athena, records survive
listing the contributing members for a number of years, thereby allowing
historians to see the magnitude of the Athenian operation.

While only the Athenian side of the story survives, it appears that the
Athenians' allies in the Delian League were not happy with the
transformation of the alliance into a full-fledged Athenian Empire.
Non-allies were affected as well. The fifth-century BCE Athenian
historian Thucydides dramatizes in his history one particularly harsh
treatment of a small island, Melos, which effectively refused to join
the Athenian cause. To add insult to injury, once the treasury of the
empire had been moved to Athens, the Athenians had used some funds from
it for their own building projects, the most famous of these projects
being the Parthenon, the great temple to Athena on the Acropolis.

The bold decision to move the treasury of the Delian League to Athens
was the brainchild of the leading Athenian statesman of the fifth
century BCE, Pericles. A member of a prominent aristocratic family,
**Pericles** was a predominant politician for forty years, from the
early 460s BCE to his death in 429 BCE, and was instrumental in the
development of a more popular democracy in Athens. Under his leadership,
an especially vibrant feeling of Athenian patriotic pride seems to have
developed. Shortly after moving the treasury to Athens, Pericles
sponsored a Citizenship Decree in 451 BCE that restricted Athenian
citizenship from thence onwards to individuals who had two freeborn and
legitimately-wed Athenian parents, both of whom were also born of
Athenian parents. Then c. 449 BCE, Pericles successfully proposed a
decree allowing the Athenians to use Delian League funds for Athenian
building projects. Later in his life, Pericles famously described Athens
as "the school of Hellas;" and with its flourishing of art and
architecture, the city was a center of philosophy and drama.

The growing wealth and power of Athens in the twenty or so years since
the Persian Wars did not escape Sparta and led to increasingly tense
relations between the two leading powers in Greece. Sparta had steadily
consolidated the Peloponnesian League in this same time period, but
Sparta's authority over this league was not quite as strict as the
Athenian control over the Delian League. Finally, in the period of
460--445 BCE, the Spartans and the Athenians engaged in a series of
battles, to which modern scholars refer as the **First Peloponnesian
War**. In 445 BCE, the two sides swore to a Thirty Years' Peace, a
treaty that allowed both sides to return to their pre-war holdings, with
few exceptions. Still, Spartan unease in this period of Athenian
expansion and prosperity, which resulted in the First Peloponnesian War,
was merely a sign of much more serious conflict to come. As the Athenian
general and historian **Thucydides** later famously wrote about the
reasons for the Great Peloponnesian War, which erupted in 431 BCE: "But
the real cause of the war was one that was formally kept out of sight.
The growing power of Athens, and the fear that it inspired in Sparta,
made the war inevitable" (Thucydides, I.23).

### 5.10.2 The Peloponnesian War (431--404 BCE) {.import-Header3}

Historians today frown on the use of the term "inevitable" to describe
historical events. Still, Thucydides' point about the inevitability of
the Peloponnesian War is perhaps appropriate. The conflict had been
bubbling under the surface for fifty years, and when war finally broke
out, it was over a seemingly minor affair. In 433 BCE, Corcyra, a colony
of Corinth that no longer wanted to be under the control of
imperialists, asked Athens for protection against Corinth. The
Corinthians claimed that the Athenian support of Corcyra was a violation
of the Thirty Years' Peace. At a subsequent meeting of the Peloponnesian
League in Sparta in 432 BCE, the allies, along with Sparta, voted that
the peace had been broken and so declared war against Athens.

At the time of the war's declaration, no one thought that it would last
twenty-seven years and would ultimately embroil the entire
Greek-speaking world. Rather, the Spartans expected that they would
march with an army to Athens, fight a decisive battle, then return home.
The long duration of the war, however, was partly the result of the
different strengths of the two leading powers. Athens was a naval
empire, with allies scattered all over the Ionian Sea. Sparta, on the
other hand, was a land-locked power with a strong contingent of foot
soldiers and supporters chiefly in the Peloponnese and with no navy to
speak of at the outset of the war.

The Peloponnesian War brought about significant changes in the
government of both Athens and Sparta, so by the end of the war, neither
power looked as it did at its outset. Athens, in particular, became more
democratic because of increased need for manpower to row its fleet. The
lowest census bracket, the *thetes*, whose poverty and inability to buy
their own armor had previously excluded them from military service,
became by the end of the war a full-fledged part of the Athenian forces
and acquired a correspondingly greater degree of political influence. In
the case of Sparta, the war had ended the Spartan policy of relative
isolationism from the rest of the affairs of the Greek city-states.
While war was previously largely a seasonal affair, with many conflicts
being decided with a single battle, the Peloponnesian War forced the
Greek city-states to support standing armies. Finally, while sieges of
cities and attacks on civilians were previously frowned upon, they
became the norm by the end of the Peloponnesian War. In short,
Thucydides' narrative of the war shows that the war had a detrimental
effect on human nature, encouraging a previously unprecedented degree of
cruelty on both sides. Still, Greek siege warfare during the fifth
century BCE was still quite primitive, as no tools existed for ramming
or otherwise damaging the city gates or walls, and catapults were not
yet in use.

Beginning in the late spring and early summer of 431 BCE, the Spartan
king Archidamus led his army to invade Attica in order to devastate the
agricultural land around the city. The Spartans thereby hoped to provoke
the Athenians to a battle. Pericles, however, refused and instead
ordered all inhabitants of Attica to retreat within the city. Pericles'
decision was wise, as the Athenians would likely have lost a land battle
against the Spartans. His decision, though, had unforeseen
repercussions. In 430 BCE, the crowded conditions within Athens resulted
in the outbreak of a virulent plague which by some estimates killed as
much as twenty-five percent of the city's population over the following
three years. Among the dead was none other than Pericles himself.
Meanwhile, the Spartans continued their annual invasions of Attica until
425 BCE, when luck was finally on the Athenians' side.

In 425 BCE, the Athenian fleet faced a new Spartan fleet in the Battle
of Pylos in the Peloponnese. The Athenians won the battle and also
managed to trap 420 Spartans on the tiny island of Sphacteria, just off
the coast of Pylos. Sending shockwaves through the entire Greek world,
the Spartans surrendered. By bringing the hostages to Athens, the
Athenians put an end to the annual invasions of Attica. Finally, in 421
BCE, with the death of the most pro-war generals on both sides, the
Athenians with their allies signed a peace treaty with the Spartans and
their allies. Named the "Peace of Nicias" after the Athenian general who
brokered this treaty, it was supposed to be a fifty years' peace; it
allowed both sides to return to their pre-war holdings, with a few
exceptions. However, several key allies of Sparta, including Corinth and
Thebes, refused to sign. Furthermore, Athens made the disastrous
decision during this stalemate to launch the **Sicilian Expedition**, a
venture that took much of the Athenian fleet to Sicily in 415 BCE.

The Spartans then took the war to Attic soil by occupying Decelea, a
village in Attica proper, and transforming it into a military fort. This
occupation allowed the Spartans to prevent the Athenians from farming
their land and cutting off Athens from most supply routes, effectively
crippling the Athenian economy for the remainder of the war. The war
produced a high level of resentment towards the democratic leaders in
Athens. Therefore, in 411 BCE, an oligarchic coup briefly replaced the
democracy with the rule of the Four Hundred. While this oligarchy was
quickly overthrown and the democracy restored, this internal instability
highlighted the presence of the aristocratic element in the city as well
as the dissatisfaction of at least the aristocratic citizens with the
long war.

Remarkably, in a testament to the resilience and power of the Athenian
state, the Athenians managed to rebuild a navy after the Sicilian
Expedition and even managed to continue to win battles on sea during
this final phase of the war. In 405 BCE, however, the Spartan general
Lysander defeated Athens in the naval battle, and the city finally
surrendered in 404 BCE. For the second time in a decade, the Athenian
democracy was overthrown, to be replaced this time by the
Spartan-sanctioned oligarchy known as the Tyranny of the Thirty. The
rule of the Thirty proved to be a much more brutal oligarchy than that
of the Four Hundred. A year later, an army formed largely of Athenian
democrats in exile marched on the city and overthrew the Thirty. The
democracy thus was restored in 403 BCE, and the painful process of
recovery from the war and the oligarchic rule could begin.

### 5.10.3 Athenian Culture during the Peloponnesian War {.import-Header3}

Because it drained Athens of manpower and financial resources, the
Peloponnesian War proved to be an utter practical disaster for Athens.
Nevertheless, the war period was also the pinnacle of Athenian culture,
most notably its tragedy, comedy, and philosophy. Tragedy and comedy in
Athens were very much popular entertainment, intended to appeal to all
citizens. Thus issues considered in these plays were often ones of
paramount concern for the city at the time when the plays were written.
As one character in a comedy bitterly joked in an address to the
audience, more Athenians attended tragic and comic performances than
came to vote at assembly meetings. Not surprisingly, war was a common
topic of discussion in the plays. Furthermore, war was not portrayed
positively, as the playwrights repeatedly emphasized the costs of war
for both winners and losers.

**Sophocles**, one of the two most prominent Athenian tragedians during
the Peloponnesian War era, had served his city as a general, albeit at
an earlier period; thus, he had direct experience with war. Many of his
tragedies that were performed during the war dealt with the darker side
of fighting, for both soldiers and generals, and the cities that were
affected. By tradition, however, tragedies tackled contemporary issues
by integrating them into mythical stories, and the two mythical wars
that Sophocles portrayed in his tragedies were the Trojan War, as in
*Ajax* and *Philoctetes*, and the aftermath of the war of the Seven
against Thebes, in which Polynices, the son of Oedipus, led six other
heroes to attack Thebes, a city led by his brother Eteocles, as in
*Oedipus at Colonus*. Sophocles' plays repeatedly showed the emotional
and psychological challenges of war for soldiers and civilians alike;
they also emphasized the futility of war, as the heroes of his plays,
just as in the original myths on which they were based, died tragic,
untimely deaths. Sophocles' younger contemporary, Euripides, had a
similar interest in depicting the horrors of war and wrote a number of
tragedies on the impact of war on the defeated, such as in *Phoenician
Women* and *Hecuba*; both of these plays explored the aftermath of the
Trojan War from the perspective of the defeated Trojans.

While the tragic playwrights explored the impact of the war on both the
fighters and the civilians through narrating mythical events, the comic
playwright **Aristophanes** was far less subtle. The anti-war civilian
who saves the day and ends the war was a common hero in the Aristophanic
comedies. For instance, in the *Acharnians*, the main character is a
war-weary farmer who, frustrated with the inefficiency of the Athenian
leadership in ending the war, brokers his own personal peace with
Sparta. Similarly, in *Peace*, another anti-war farmer fattens up a dung
beetle in order to fly to Olympus and beg Zeus to free Peace. Finally,
in *Lysistrata*, the wives of all Greek city-states, missing their
husbands who are at war, band together in a plot to end the war by going
on a sex strike until their husbands make peace. By the end of the play,
their wish comes true. Undeniably funny, the jokes in these comedies,
nevertheless, have a bitter edge, akin to the portrayal of war in the
tragedies. The overall impression from the war-era drama is that the
playwrights, as well as perhaps the Athenians themselves, spent much of
the Peloponnesian War dreaming of peace.

While the playwrights were dreaming of the things of this world---most
notably war---their contemporary, **Socrates**, was dreaming of
difficult questions. One of the most prominent philosophers of the
ancient world, Socrates has not left any writings of his own, but
thoughts attributed to him survive in dialogues penned by his student,
the fourth-century philosopher **Plato**. In Plato's writings, Socrates
comes across as someone who loved difficult questions and who was not
above confronting any passers-by with such questions as "What is
courage?"; "What is moral?"; "What would the ideal city look like?"
Using what became known ever since as the "Socratic method," Socrates
continued to probe further every definition and answer that his
conversation partners provided, guiding them to delve deeper in their
reflections on the topics at hand than they had before. As a result of
his love of such debates, Socrates was seen as connected to the
Sophists, philosophical debate teachers, who (as Aristophanes joked)
could teach anyone to convince others of anything at all, regardless of
reality or truth. But Socrates radically differed from the Sophists by
not charging fees for his teaching. Instead, as he himself is purported
to have said, he was a pest-like gadfly that kept disturbing Athens from
growing too content and encouraged all with whom he spoke to keep
thinking and questioning.

### 5.10.4 The Fourth Century BCE {.import-Header3}

In 399 BCE, a seventy-year-old Athenian was put on trial for impiety and
for corrupting the youth, convicted, and speedily sentenced to death.
The trial is especially shocking since the man in question was none
other than Socrates, the philosopher who had spent his life wandering
the streets of Athens engaging in endless dialogues regarding the
meaning of life. Why did the Athenians suddenly turn against this public
teacher and judge him worthy of execution? The answer, most likely, is
not the openly-stated causes of the trial but rather the connections
that Socrates previously had to oligarchic leaders. In particular,
Socrates had taught Critias, who became one of the Thirty in 404 BCE.
Fueled by their hatred of all enemies of the democracy and anyone who
had associated with the Thirty, the Athenians condemned Socrates to
death. This trial shows how deeply the scars went in the collective
psyche and how difficult it was for the Athenians to forget the terrible
end of the Peloponnesian War. And while, as usual, more information
survives about how the Athenians---more than any other *polis*---dealt
with the aftermath of the war, it is clear that for the rest of the
Greek world, their life in the fourth century BCE was very much the
result of the Peloponnesian War.

The early fourth century saw a power vacuum emerge in the Greek world
for the first time since the early Archaic Period. Defeated in the war,
Athens was no longer an empire, while the winner, Sparta, had suffered a
catastrophic decline in its population over the course of the
Peloponnesian War. At the same time, Thebes had revamped its military,
introducing the first two significant changes to the hoplite phalanx way
of fighting since its inception: slightly longer spears and wedge
formation. The final key to the Theban military supremacy was the
**Theban Sacred Band**, formed in 378 BCE. An elite core of 300
warriors, the band consisted of 150 couples, based on the assumption
that the lovers would fight most bravely in order not to appear to be
cowardly to their beloved. In 371 BCE, the Thebans demonstrated the
success of their military reforms by defeating the Spartans at the
Battle of Leuctra. They continued an aggressive program of military
expansion over the next decade, a period known as the **Theban
Hegemony**. Sometime in the 360s BCE, a young Macedonian prince stayed
for several years in Thebes as a hostage. Circa 364 BCE, the prince
returned to Macedon, and in 359 BCE, he ascended to the throne as King
**Philip II**. Up until that point in Greek history, the Macedonians had
largely been known for two things: drinking their wine undiluted, which
had marked them as complete and utter barbarians in the eyes of the rest
of the Greeks, and being excellent horsemen. With Philip at the helm,
this estimation was about to change. As soon as he came to the throne,
Philip began transforming the Macedonian military into a more successful
image of what he had seen at Thebes. Philip further lengthened the
already longer spears used by the Thebans, creating the Macedonian
*sarissa*, a spear of about eighteen feet in length, double that of the
traditional Greek hoplite spear.

He retained the Theban wedge formation but also added heavy cavalry to
the line, thus incorporating the Macedonians' strongest element into the
phalanx. The results spoke for themselves, as over the next twenty
years, Philip systematically conquered all of mainland Greece, with the
exception of Sparta, which he chose to leave alone. Philip's final great
victory, which he shared with his teenage son Alexander, was at the
Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), in which the Macedonian armies defeated
the combined forces of Athens and Thebes. Philip's conquest of the
entire mainland was the end of an era, as for the first time, the entire
territory was united under the rule of a king.

By all accounts, it appears that Philip was not going to stop at just
conquering the Greek world. He did not, however, have this choice. In
336 BCE, while on his way to a theatrical performance, Philip was
assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. His son Alexander, then
twenty years old, succeeded and continued his father's ambitious program
of conquests. Alexander's first target was the Persian Empire, motivated
in part by his love of Homer's *Iliad* and the perception among the
Greeks that this new campaign was the continuation of the original,
mythical war against Asia. Moving farther and farther East in his
campaigns, Alexander conquered the Balkans, Egypt, and the territories
of modern-day Lebanon, Syria, and Israel before he achieved a decisive
victory over Darius III at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE.

Continuing to move eastwards, Alexander invaded India in 327 BCE,
planning to conquer the known world and assuming that he was close to
this achievement since the Greeks of his day were not aware of China's
existence. His war-weary troops, however, rebelled in 326 BCE and
demanded to return home (see Chapter 3). It appears that this mutiny was
not the first that occurred in Alexander's army; indeed, over the course
of his rule, Alexander had also been the target of a number of failed
assassinations. However, this mutiny forced Alexander to give in.
Leaving several of his officers behind as satraps, a regional
government, Alexander turned back. In 323 BCE, he and his army reached
Babylon, the city that he had hoped to make the new capital of his world
empire. There, Alexander fell ill and died at the ripe old age of
thirty-three.

While Alexander's rule only lasted thirteen years, his legacy reshaped
Greece and the rest of ancient Eurasia for the next several centuries. A
charismatic leader, albeit one prone to emotional outbursts, Alexander
redefined what it meant to be king and general. His coinage reflects
this reinvention. On one coin minted during his lifetime, for instance,
appears Alexander dressed as the hero Heracles, while Zeus, whom
Alexander alleged to be his real father, appears on the other side.

In addition, by conquering territories that were previously not part of
the Greek world, Alexander spread Greek culture farther than had anyone
else before him. At the same time, by marrying several non-Greek
princesses and encouraging such marriages by his troops, Alexander also
encouraged the creation of a "melting-pot" empire; he further cemented
this creation by founding some 20 new cities named after himself all
over his new empire, incorporating a cosmopolitan culture. In
particular, Alexandria, the city that he founded in Egypt, became a
center of Greek civilization---albeit with an Egyptian twist---and was
seen as a new Athens well into the Roman Empire. Alexander's brief time
in India produced a significant impact as well, as in 321 BCE,
Chandragupta Maurya was able to unify India into a single kingdom for
the first time, establishing the **Mauryan Empire** (see Chapter 3).
Finally, in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Greek world,
Alexander's generals divided his conquests into several kingdoms that
they and their descendants continued to rule until the Romans conquered
these respective areas. It appears that Alexander's melting-pot empire,
burning up as a phoenix upon his death, actually allowed several new
empires and kingdoms to arise from its ashes.

## 5.11 HELLENISTIC PERIOD {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Historians today consider the death of Alexander to be the end point of
the Classical Period and the beginning of the **Hellenistic Period**.
That moment, for historians, also marks the end of the *polis* as the
main unit of organization in the Greek world. While city-states
continued to exist, the main unit of organization from that point on was
the great Hellenistic kingdoms. These kingdoms, encompassing much
greater territory than the Greek world had before Alexander, contributed
to the thorough Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean and the
Middle East. The age of the Hellenistic kingdoms also coincided with the
rise of Rome as a military power in the West. Ultimately, the
Hellenistic kingdoms were conquered and absorbed by Rome.

### 5.11.1 Hellenistic Kingdoms {.import-Header3}

Although Alexander had several children from his different wives, he did
not leave an heir old enough to take power upon his death. Indeed, his
only son, Alexander IV, was only born several months after his father's
death. Instead, Alexander's most talented generals turned against each
other in a contest for the control of the empire that they had helped
create.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 647px">

</figure>

These Wars of the Diadochi, as they are known in modern scholarship,
ended with a partition of Alexander's empire into a number of kingdoms,
each ruled by dynasties. Of these, the four most influential dynasties
which retained power for the remainder of the Hellenistic Age were the
following: Seleucus, who took control of Syria and the surrounding
areas, thus creating the **Seleucid Empire**; Antigonus Monophthalmos,
the One-Eyed, who took over the territory of Asia Minor and northern
Syria, establishing the **Antigonid Dynasty**; the Attalid Dynasty,
which took power over the **Kingdom of Pergamon** after the death of its
initial ruler, Lysimachus, a general of Alexander; and Ptolemy,
Alexander's most influential general, who took control over Egypt,
establishing the **Ptolemaic Dynasty**.

The most imperialistic of Alexander's successors, Seleucus I Nicator
took Syria, swiftly expanding his empire to the east to encompass the
entire stretch of territory from Syria to India. At its greatest
expanse, this territory's ethnic diversity was similar to that of
Alexander's original empire, and Seleucus adopted the same policy of
ethnic unity as originally practiced by Alexander; some of Seleucus'
later successors, however, attempted to impose Hellenization on some of
the peoples under their rule. These successors had difficulties holding
on to Seleucus' conquests. A notable exception, Antiochus III, attempted
to expand the empire into Anatolia and Greece in the early second
century BCE but was ultimately defeated by the Romans. The empire's
story for the remainder of its existence is one of almost constant civil
wars and increasingly declining territories. The Seleucids seem to have
had a particularly antagonistic relationship with their Jewish subjects,
going so far as to outlaw Judaism in 168 BCE. The Jewish holiday
**Hannukah** celebrates a miracle that occurred following the historical
victory of the Jews, led by Judah Maccabee, over the Seleucids in 165
BCE. Shortly afterward, the Seleucids had to allow autonomy to the
Jewish state; it achieved full independence from Seleucid rule in 129
BCE. In 63 BCE, the Roman general Pompey finally conquered the small
remnant of the Seleucid Empire, making it into the Roman province of
Syria.

Antigonus Monophthalmos, Seleucus' neighbor, whose holdings included
Macedonia, Asia Minor, and the northwestern portion of Syria, harbored
ambitious plans that rivaled those of Seleucus. Antigonus' hopes of
reuniting all of Alexander's original empire under his own rule,
however, were never realized, as Antigonus died in battle in 301 BCE.
The greatest threat to the Antigonids, however, came not from the
Seleucid Empire but from Rome, with whom they waged three Macedonian
Wars between 214 and 168 BCE. The Roman defeat of king Perseus in 168
BCE at the Battle of Pydna marked the end of the Third Macedonian War
and the end of an era, as control over Greece was now in Roman hands.

The smallest and least imperialistic of the successor states, the
kingdom of Pergamon, was originally part of a very short-lived empire
established by Lysimachus, one of Alexander's generals. Lysimachus
originally held Macedonia and parts of Asia Minor and Thrace but had
lost all of these territories by the time of his death in 281 BCE. One
of his officers, Philetaerus, however, took over the city of Pergamon,
establishing there the Attalid Dynasty that transformed Pergamon into a
small and successful kingdom. The final Attalid king, Attalus III, left
his kingdom to Rome in his will in 133 BCE.

Lasting from the death of Alexander in 323 BCE to the death of Cleopatra
VII in 30 BCE, the Ptolemaic kingdom proved to be the longest-lasting
and most successful of the kingdoms carved from Alexander's initial
empire. Its founder, Ptolemy I Soter, was a talented general, as well as
an astronomer, philosopher, and historian, who wrote his own histories
of Alexander's campaigns. Aiming to make Alexandria the new Athens of
the Mediterranean, Ptolemy spared no expense in building the Museum, an
institution of learning and research that included, most famously, the
**Great Library of Alexandria**, and worked tirelessly to attract
scholars and cultured elite to his city. Subsequent Ptolemies continued
these works so that Alexandria held its reputation as a cultural capital
into Late Antiquity. One example of a particularly impressive scientific
discovery is the work of Eratosthenes, the head librarian at the Great
Library in the second half of the third century BCE, who accurately
calculated the earth's circumference. But while the Ptolemies brought
with them the Greek language and culture to Egypt, they were also
profoundly influenced by Egyptian customs. Portraying themselves as the
new Pharaohs, the Ptolemies even adopted the Egyptian royal custom of
brother-sister marriages, a practice that eventually percolated down to
the general populace as well. Unfortunately, brother-sister marriages
did not prevent strife for power within the royal family. The last of
the Ptolemaic rulers, Cleopatra VII, first married and ruled jointly
with her brother Ptolemy XIII. After defeating him in a civil war, she
then married another brother, Ptolemy XIV, remaining his wife until his
death, possibly from sisterly poisoning. Best known for her affairs with
Julius Caesar and, after Caesar's death, with Marcus Antonius, Cleopatra
teamed with Marcus Antonius in a bid for the Roman Empire. The last
surviving ruler who was descended from one of Alexander's generals, she
was finally defeated by Octavian, the future Roman emperor Augustus, in
30 BCE.

The history of the successor states that resulted from the carving of
Alexander's empire shows the imperialistic drive of Greek generals while
also demonstrating the instability of their empires. Historians do not
typically engage in counter-factual speculations, but it is very likely
that had he lived longer, Alexander would have seen his empire unravel,
as no structure was really in place to hold it together. At the same
time, the clash of cultures that Alexander's empire and the successor
states produced resulted in the spread of Greek culture and language
further than ever before; simultaneously, it also introduced the Greeks
to other peoples, thus bringing foreign customs---such as the
brother-sister marriages in Egypt---into the lives of the Greeks living
outside the original Greek world.

### 5.11.2 Hellenistic Culture {.import-Header3}

The Hellenistic kingdoms spread Greek language, culture, and art all
over the areas of Alexander's former conquests. Furthermore, many
Hellenistic kings, especially the Ptolemies, were patrons of art and
ideas. Thus the Hellenistic era saw the flourishing of art and
architecture, philosophy, medical and scientific writing, and even
translations of texts of other civilizations into Greek. The undisputed
center for these advances was Alexandria.

Combining the practical with the ambitious, the Pharos, or Lighthouse,
of Alexandria was one of the most famous examples of Hellenistic
architecture and has remained a symbol of the city to the present day.
Constructed in 280 BCE, it was considered to be one of the Seven Wonders
of the Ancient World and was one of the tallest buildings in the world
at the time. While its practical purpose was to guide ships into the
harbor at night, it also exemplified the bold advances and experimental
spirit of Hellenistic architecture. Indeed, it was located on a man-made
mole off the coast of the city. The building comprised three layers, the
top one of which housed the furnace that produced the light.

The structure of the Pharos shows an interest in straight lines and
orderly shapes, while its function symbolized the ability of man to
subdue the sea, even by night. Similarly, both the scientific and
medical texts from the Hellenistic Period reveal a fascination with an
ordered universe and an interest in discovering how it worked.
Herophilus of Chalcedon, for instance, pioneered dissection in the early
third century BCE and was especially interested in the human brain and
the nervous system. The mathematician Euclid, who lived and worked in
Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323--283 BCE), wrote the
*Elements*, an encyclopedic work of mathematics that effectively created
the discipline of geometry. Going a step further than Euclid in his
research, the third-century BCE scientist and inventor **Archimedes of
Syracuse** specialized in applying mathematical concepts to create such
devices as a screw pump and a variety of war machines, including the
heat ray.

The same fascination with studying the order of the universe appears in
Hellenistic philosophy and stems ultimately from the philosophy of
Aristotle (384--322 BCE), considered to be the last Classical Greek
philosopher. Aristotle was a prolific polymath, who wrote on political
theory, poetry, music, and a variety of sciences, to list just some of
his interests. Engrossed in seeing all disciplines as part of a larger
world order, Aristotle specifically argued for empiricism---that is, the
belief that knowledge is acquired from sensory experiences rather than
from intuition. In the sciences, for instance, this approach required
experiments and the careful gathering of data. While Aristotle's
influence on the Hellenistic philosophers is undeniable, the alternate
theories that some of the philosophers developed regarding the structure
of the universe and the place of humanity in it differs drastically from
Aristotle's view. For instance, Skepticism, especially as formulated by
Pyrrho in the third century BCE, argued that it was impossible to reach
any accurate conclusions about the world and the key to happiness was to
stop trying. Cynic philosophers, starting in the fourth century BCE,
advocated the ascetic life of simplicity and freedom from possessions. A
related philosophy, **Stoicism**, argued for letting go of all emotions
and developing a self-control that would allow one to live in accordance
to nature. On the other hand, the third-century philosophy of
**Epicureanism** argued for the absence of pain as the ultimate goal in
life and saw the universe as ruled by random chance, separate from the
intervention of the gods. All of these philosophies, and many others
that co-existed with them, aimed to provide a coherent system that made
sense of the world and provided a purpose for human life.

Finally, in a testament to the deep influence of the Hellenistic
language culture on the conquered regions, the Hellenistic Period saw
the translation of texts of other civilizations into Greek. One
particularly influential example was the translation of the Hebrew Old
Testament into Greek. Jews formed a significant minority of the
population of Alexandria, the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt, as well as
other major cities around the Mediterranean, such as Antioch. By the
third century BCE, these Jews appear to have largely lost the knowledge
of Hebrew; thus, a translation of the sacred texts into Greek was
necessary. In addition, as later legend has it, Ptolemy II Philadelphus
allegedly commissioned seventy-two scholars to translate the Old
Testament into Greek for his Royal Library. Whether indeed solicited by
Ptolemy II or not, the translation was likely completed over the course
of the third through first centuries BCE. Named after the legendary
seventy-two (or, in some versions, seventy) translators, the text was
titled the *Septuagint*. The completion of this translation showed the
thorough Hellenization of even the Jews, who had largely kept themselves
apart from mainstream culture of the cities in which they lived.

## 5.12 CONCLUSION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

"Captive Greece has conquered her rude conqueror," the Roman poet Horace
famously wrote in the late first century BCE. This comment about the
deep influence of Greek culture on the Roman world, even after the Roman
conquest of Greece was complete, continued to be the case well after the
days of Horace. Ultimately, the impact of the Hellenization of the
Mediterranean and the Middle East, which started with Alexander's
conquests, lasted far beyond the Hellenistic kingdoms, as the Greek
language continued to be the language of the Eastern Roman Empire and,
subsequently, the Byzantine Empire up until the conquest of that
territory by the Ottomans in 1453 CE. In some respects, this spread of
the Greeks and their civilization ultimately changed what it meant to be
Greek---or, rather, it created a more universal Greek identity, which
largely replaced the *polis*-specific view of citizenship and identity
that existed before Philip's conquest of Greece. And yet, certain
cultural constants persisted.

The first of these was Homer, whose epics continued to be as great
inspiration to the Greeks of the Roman world as they were to their
Archaic Age counterparts. For instance, the Homeric values were likely
the reason for the minimal advances in military technology in the Greek
world, as honor was more important than military success at all cost.
The second cultural constant was the work of the philosophers Plato and
Aristotle, in whose shadows all subsequent philosophers of the
Greco-Roman world labored. Even as the Greek-speaking portions of the
Roman Empire turned to Christianity, they could not abandon their
philosophical roots, resulting, for instance, in the Gnostic heresies.
Horace's cheeky comment thus proved to be true far longer than he could
have expected.

## 6.2 INTRODUCTION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In 458 BCE, facing a military attack from the two neighboring tribes of
the Aequi and the Sabines, the Roman Senate took a drastic measure,
reserved for the direst of circumstances: they appointed a dictator, who
would single-handedly lead the state in this time of trouble. As the
Roman historian Livy tells it, **Cincinnatus**, the senator who was
appointed dictator, received the news while working on his farm.
Abandoning the plow, he immediately rushed to join the army, which he
then led to a swift and brilliant victory. Then something astonishing
happened: Cincinnatus resigned his extraordinary powers and returned to
his farm. For the remainder of the Roman Republic, and well into the
Imperial Period, Cincinnatus continued to be seen as the quintessential
Roman cultural hero and model of virtue: an aristocratic man who was a
talented soldier, general, and politician who put the interests of Rome
first, above his own. While no other Roman politician displayed
Cincinnatus' degree of self-sacrificing humility, the other Roman heroes
of the Republic and the Empire were still uniformly male, predominantly
aristocratic, and famed for military and political achievements.

But something happened to give rise to a rather different sort of
cultural hero by the Late Roman Empire. In 203 CE, a young noblewoman
and her slave were executed in Carthage, thrown into the arena with the
lions. Their crime? A stubborn faith: the belief that a Jewish man who
lived in Judaea a century earlier was the son of God who had died on the
cross and rose again. The two women, Perpetua and Felicity, gave up a
life of relative comfort and the chance to raise their babies---indeed,
Felicity gave birth in prison mere hours before her execution!---placing
their God above all else. They were not the only ones. Stories of
martyrs abound in the Later Roman Empire and were told repeatedly by
Christians, thus perpetuating the status of these martyrs as the new
cultural heroes. But far from repelling others from imitating their
example, these stories, rather, encouraged the rise of more willing
martyrs to follow their suit. As a result of the spread of Christianity,
therefore, the Roman cultural heroes of Late Antiquity were different
from Cincinnatus. Instead of aristocratic generals and politicians, they
were nursing mothers and even slave-women who chose to die a humiliating
and painful death for their faith and its promise of an eternal reward.

The story of the Roman world from the foundation of the city of Rome to
the fall of the Roman Empire in the West is, overall, a tale of two
different transformations. The first of these is the dramatic
transformation in cultural values and beliefs, a glimpse of which is
reflected in the two stories above. The second is a similarly dramatic
geographical transformation, which also brought about drastic clashes of
cultures and a variety of changes throughout the entire Mediterranean
world and beyond. This was the transformation of a small village on the
Tiber into one of the largest empires in all of world history, followed
by a collapse of a part of that Empire, but a collapse from whose ashes
arose what we now know as Europe.

## 6.5 GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY OF ROME AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

As the title of one recent textbook of Roman history puts it, Roman
history is the story of Rome's transformation "from village to empire."
[^\[1\]^](#chapter-006-unknown-4.xhtml_footnote-407-1 "Mary Boatwright, Daniel Gargola, Noel Lenski, and Richard Talbert, The Romans: From Village to Empire: A History of Rome from Earliest Times to the End of the Western Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011)"){#chapter-006-unknown-4.xhtml_return-footnote-407-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"} The geography and topography of Rome,
Italy, and the Mediterranean world played a key role in the expansion of
the empire but also placed challenges in the Romans' path, challenges
which further shaped their history.

Before it became the capital of a major empire, **Rome** was a village
built on seven hills sprawling around the river **Tiber**. Set sixteen
miles inland, the original settlement had distinct strategic advantages:
it was immune to attacks from the sea, and the seven hills on which the
city was built were easy to fortify. The Tiber, although marshy and
prone to flooding, provided the ability to trade with neighboring
city-states. By the mid-Republic, requiring access to the sea, the
Romans built a harbor at **Ostia**, which grew to become a full-fledged
commercial arm of Rome. Wheeled vehicles were prohibited inside the city
of Rome during the day in order to protect the heavy pedestrian traffic.
Thus, at night, carts from Ostia poured into Rome, delivering food and
other goods for sale from all over Italy and the empire.

One of the most surprising aspects of the history of early Rome is that
despite constant threats from its more powerful neighbors, it was never
swallowed by them. The **Etruscans** dominated much of northern Italy
down to Rome, while the southern half of Italy was so heavily colonized
by the Greeks that it was called "**Magna Graecia**," meaning "Great
Greece." In addition, several smaller tribes hemmed the early Romans,
mainly, the Latins, the Aequi, and the Sabines.

The topography of Rome---the advantage of the hills and the
river---likely was a boon in the city's struggles against its neighbors.
Likewise, the topography of Italy, with the Alps and the Apennines
providing natural defenses in the north, hampered invasions from the
outside. Indeed, the most famous example of an invasion from the north,
that of Hannibal during the Second Punic War, is a case in point: he
selected that challenging route through the Alps to surprise the Romans,
and it proved even more destructive for his forces than he had
anticipated.

As Rome built a Mediterranean empire, the city itself grew increasingly
larger, reaching a population of one million by 100 CE. While Italy
boasted fertile farmlands, feeding the city of Rome became a challenge
that required the resources of the larger empire. Egypt, in particular,
became known as the breadbasket of Rome. As a result, emperors were
especially cautious to control access to Egypt by prominent senators and
other politicians, for fear of losing control over this key area of the
empire.

During the rule of the emperor Trajan in the early second century CE,
the Roman Empire reached its greatest extent, stretching to Britain in
the west, slightly beyond the Rhine and Danube Rivers in the north, and
including much of the Near East and North Africa.

Topography, however, played a role in the Romans' ultimately
unsuccessful struggle to hold on to these territories after Trajan's
death. The natural frontier offered by the Rhine and Danube Rivers made
it difficult for the Romans to maintain control over the territories on
the other side of them. Struggling to fight off the warrior tribes in
northern Britain, two second-century CE emperors---Hadrian and Antoninus
Pius---built successive walls, which attempted to separate the
un-Romanized tribes from the territory under Roman control. Finally, a
persistent challenge for Roman emperors was the location of the empire's
capital. When the Roman Empire consisted of Italy alone, the location of
Rome in the middle of the Italian peninsula was ideal. Once the empire
controlled areas far in all directions, Rome was a great distance from
all the problem frontiers. As a result, emperors over the course of the
second and third centuries spent less time in Rome. Finally,
Diocletian's division of the empire in 293 CE into four administrative
regions, each with a regional capital, left Rome out. In 330 CE, the
emperor Constantine permanently moved the capital of the empire to his
new city of Constantinople, built at the site of the older Greek city of
Byzantium.

The large area encompassed by the empire required a sophisticated
infrastructure of roads and sea routes, and the Romans provided both. By
the first century CE, these roads and routes connected the center of the
empire (Rome) to the periphery, providing ways for armies, politicians,
traders, tourists, and students to travel with greater security and
speed than ever before. As primary sources reveal, travel was never a
fully safe undertaking. Bandits lurked on roads and pirates on seas;
greedy locals were always eager to fleece unsuspecting tourists; and
ship-wrecks were an unfortunately common reality. Still, the empire
created an unprecedented transportation system that allowed someone in
one part of the empire to be able to travel to any other part, provided
they were wealthy enough to afford the journey.

## 6.6 BASIC CHRONOLOGY AND PERIODS OF ROMAN HISTORY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

According to Roman tradition, Rome was founded as a monarchy. That
monarchy, however, was not long-lived, and its history is overshadowed
by myth and legend. Historians have often divided Roman history into two
major periods, based on the type of government that Rome had at the
time: the **Republic** (from the sixth century BCE to the first century
BCE) and the **Empire** (from the first century BCE to the fall of the
Western half of the empire in the fifth century CE). As seen in the
writings of the Roman historian Tacitus, by the late first century CE,
Romans themselves thought of their history in these terms. The basic
difference between the two periods is quite simple. During the period of
the Republic, Rome was ruled by a Republican government, which
distributed power, in theory, among all Roman citizens. In practice,
this was really an aristocratic oligarchy. By contrast, under the
Empire, Rome was governed by one ruler, the Emperor.
[^\[2\]^](#chapter-006-unknown-4.xhtml_footnote-407-2 "Recent research, however, has challenged the over-simplification of Roman history that can be implied by thinking of it as comprising just two periods. The work of Harriet Flower has shown that the Roman Republic is best conceived of as a series of Republics, each with distinct features. The work of Peter Brown, furthermore, has challenged the myth of the “decline and fall” of the Roman Empire, first popularized by Edward Gibbon, a nineteenth-century British historian of Rome. Brown has shown that as a result of the Christianization of the Roman world, Roman culture in the Late Empire was quite different from that in the earlier periods, yet it was very much a flourishing culture."){#chapter-006-unknown-4.xhtml_return-footnote-407-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"}

This chapter proceeds chronologically, sub-dividing both the Republic
and the Empire into early and late periods while also devoting some
attention to certain thematic topics that are key to understanding each
period.

## 6.7 SOURCES AND PROBLEMS {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

One of the greatest challenges to modern historians of Rome is the
Romans' apparent lack of interest in writing their own history for their
first 600 years. According to Roman legend, Rome was founded in 753 BCE.
The first Roman history in Latin, *Origins*, composed by the Republican
politician Cato the Elder, was not published until 149 BCE. A few
senators had written about Roman history in Greek earlier on, and some
aristocrats kept family histories, but Cato's work was truly the first
Roman history on a large scale, as it narrated events from the
foundation of the city to Cato's own death. Only fragments of Cato's
history survive; they reveal that Cato's approach to the writing of
history was rather unusual. Instead of referring to individuals in Roman
history by name, Cato referred to them by title or political position.
As a result, his history was truly focused on Rome and aimed to glorify
the accomplishments of Rome rather than individual Romans. Thankfully
for modern historians, Cato's experiment of nameless history did not
catch on with subsequent Roman historians. Modern historians are able to
reconstruct the story of the Romans from a variety of written and
archaeological sources, but some of these sources present problems of
which the historian must be aware. Historians of Rome must at times
engage in educated guessing when attempting to reconstruct a picture of
Rome and Romans based on the limited evidence that is available.

Because the genre of historical writing started so late in Rome, few
histories survive from the period of the Republic. Of these, the most
famous is the work of **Livy**, who wrote his *Ab Urbe Condita* (From
the Foundation of the City) in the late first century BCE. Livy appears
to have had access to sources that are now lost, such as family
histories from aristocratic families. As the title indicates, Livy began
his work with the legends about the founding of Rome. He continued his
narrative down to his time, the age of Augustus, and the last known
events in his work covered the year 9 BCE. Although Livy's work
consisted of 142 books, only about a quarter survives, including the
first ten books, covering the Regal Period and the early Republic and
the narrative of the first two Punic Wars. Other prominent historians of
the Republic whose works survive include Sallust, a contemporary of
Caesar who turned to writing moralistic history after a frustrating
political career, and Caesar himself, who wrote two books about his own
campaigns: the *Gallic* *Wars*, about his conquest of Gaul in the 50s
BCE, and the *Civil* *War*, about his civil war against Pompey in 49--45
BCE.

The works of two prominent historians survive from the Roman Empire. In
the second century CE, **Tacitus** wrote two works about the first
century of the Roman Empire. The *Annals* covered the rule of the
emperors Tiberius through Nero, while the *Histories* continued the
narrative to the rule of the emperor Domitian. Significant portions of
both works survive. Ammianus Marcellinus, a military officer writing in
the late fourth century CE, saw himself as a successor of Tacitus; he
composed a massive history of the Roman Empire from the end of Tacitus'
work to his own day. In addition, the sensationalizing biographer
**Suetonius**, a contemporary of Tacitus, composed tabloid-style
biographies of the first twelve emperors (from Caesar to Domitian).

In addition to these Roman historians and biographers, Greek historical
works survive from the late Republic and the Empire. In the late first
century BCE, Diodorus of Sicily wrote a massive universal history that
includes key events of Roman history, alongside Greek history and
mythology. The Greek biographer **Plutarch**, writing in the first
century CE, paired for the sake of comparison biographies of famous
Greeks and Romans; one exemplary pairing is that of Alexander the Great
and Julius Caesar. Josephus, a Jewish rebel leader turned Roman citizen,
wrote the *Jewish* *War*, a detailed account of the disastrous Jewish
revolt against Rome in the 60s CE.

Works of history, however, are only one type of source that modern
historians of Rome use. Other written sources include poems, novels,
letters of politicians and other prominent figures, military and farming
manuals, cookbooks, etc. For instance, one of the best sources for the
political ideology of the Augustan age is **Vergil**'s epic poem
***Aeneid***, which tells the story of the Trojan hero Aeneas and his
struggle to reach Italy after the fall of Troy to found Rome. Arguably
the single best source for everyday life in the Roman provinces under
the Empire is Apuleius' novel *Metamorphoses*, better known under the
title *Golden Ass*. The novel is a fictional account of a man
accidentally turned into a donkey, who tells the narrative of his
travels through the Roman Empire in the late second century CE. And one
of the best sources for the government of Roman provinces is the
correspondence of Pliny the Younger, governor of the province of
Bithynia on the shores of the Black Sea in 111--113 CE, with the emperor
Trajan.

Early Christianity is one area of Roman history that has been especially
well documented from its inception. The New Testament is an invaluable
source, as it presents sources by early Christians about their own faith
and its spread throughout the Roman Empire. A variety of popular
heretical texts from the second and third centuries also survives and
allows historians to reconstruct some of the dissenting views held in
the early church. Writings in Greek and Latin by influential figures in
the early church, dubbed the Church Fathers, document the theological
debates that resulted ultimately in the Nicene Creed. Starting in the
second century CE, martyrdom accounts and saints' lives provide
admittedly semi-fictional and stylized biographies of individual
believers. Finally, two prominent theologians in the Late Empire
attempted to write (or re-write) Roman history specifically through a
Christian lens. Eusebius, the Bishop of Caesarea in the fourth century
CE, wrote the *History* *of* *the* *Church*, focusing on the history of
Christianity from its beginnings to his day. In the early fifth century
CE, **Augustine**, Bishop of Hippo in North Africa, wrote the *City*
*of* *God*, a massive work covering history and legends of Rome from its
beginnings to his day. It was an attempt to show that Rome's previous
successes were due not to adherence to the pagan gods but instead always
to the Christian God's mercy.

Archaeological sources provide further insight into Roman life. Examples
of sources that survive include inscriptions, especially gravestones;
traded goods, such as lamps or bricks, which allow historians to
reconstruct the movement of goods across the empire; and Roman towns and
military camps.

**Pompeii** is an example of the random way some sources survive. The
eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE caused volcanic ash to rain down on the
resort town of Pompeii and the nearby town of Herculaneum, burying both
towns and preserving them completely for modern archaeologists.

Although abundant sources survive from different periods of Roman
history, certain perspectives are difficult to reconstruct. For
instance, slaves in the Roman world were as archaeologically invisible
as in the Greek world. Likewise, very little evidence documents women's
lives before the rise of Christianity, and their voices are largely left
out from Roman history. Other than epitaphs on their gravestones, most
Romans left no record of their lives, so our evidence is dominated by
the history of the aristocracy. Still, the careful historian can gain at
least some insight into these lesser-documented perspectives by
gathering all references to them in sources that survive.

## 6.8 EARLY AND MIDDLE REPUBLIC {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The period from the founding of Rome to the end of the Punic Wars is
less documented than subsequent Roman history. Nevertheless, this period
was the formative time during which Rome grew from a village on the
Tiber to a pan-Mediterranean empire.

The process was as fascinating for later Romans as for outsiders. The
Greek politician-turned-historian **Polybius**, who spent seventeen
years as a hostage in Rome and became a fan of the Roman military and
political machine, put it simply in the prologue to his *Histories*:

> For who is so worthless or lazy as not to wish to know by what means
> and under what system of government the Romans in less than
> fifty-three years have succeeded in subjugating nearly the entire
> known world to their rule, an achievement unprecedented in history?
> (Polybius 1.1.5)

Polybius' question pointed to the answer that he subsequently proposed:
part of the reason for the Romans' success was their adoption of the
Republican government as a replacement for their original monarchy.
Polybius became increasingly convinced during his stay in Rome that the
Romans' government was superior to all others in the Mediterranean.

## 6.8.1 From Monarchy to Republic: Some Myths and Legends {.import-Header3}

"In the beginning, kings held Rome." Thus the late first-century CE
Roman historian Tacitus opened his *Annals*, a history of the Empire
under the rule of the emperors from Tiberius to Nero. Early Roman
history is shrouded in myth and legend, but the beliefs of later Romans
about their own past are important to consider. These beliefs, whether
truly grounded in reality, shaped subsequent decisions and actions. This
tendency is especially true of the Romans' myths about the foundation of
their city in 753 BCE and the kings who ruled it until the establishment
of the Republic in 510 BCE.

According to myth, Rome received its name from its founder **Romulus**,
the son of the war god Mars and a descendant of the Trojan hero Aeneas.
By linking themselves to the Trojans, the Romans were able to boast an
ancient, reputable lineage, rivaling that of the Greeks, and a prominent
place in the Greek heroic epic, Homer's *Iliad*. Furthermore, when
embarking on a conquest of Greece later on, the Romans could claim to be
seeking revenge for their Trojan ancestors' defeat and destruction
during the Trojan War. Several generations removed from their heroic
ancestor Aeneas, Romulus and his twin brother **Remus** were famously
abandoned as infants and then nursed by a she-wolf, the sacred animal of
their father Mars.

<figure id="attachment_375" class="wp-caption aligncenter"

<figcaption>Figure 6.4 | She-Wolf Suckles Romulus and Remus Author: User

</figure>

The sweetness of the story ends there, however. While Romulus was
building Rome, Remus insulted the new city, and his brother killed him
to avenge its honor. Later, after Romulus had completed the building of
the new city with his band of soldiers, he realized the lack of women in
the city, so Romulus and his supporters raided the neighboring tribe,
the Sabines, and kidnapped their women.

It is telling that later Romans believed that their city was founded on
fraternal bloodshed, as well as on rape and kidnapping. The stories of
Romulus' accomplishments, while not laudatory, show an important Roman
belief: the greatness of Rome sometimes required morally reprehensible
actions. In other words, Rome came first, and if the good of the city
required the sacrifice of one's brother, or required force against
others, then the gods ordained these actions.

Romans believed that their city was ruled by seven different kings in
succession. After Romulus, king Numa Pompilius regulated Roman religion
and created many of the priestly colleges and positions that continued
to exist thereafter. The seventh and final king, however, Tarquin the
Proud, was known for his and his family's brutality. The final straw
appears to have been the rape of a nobleman's wife, Lucretia, by the
king's son. An aristocratic revolution ensued, which appears to have
been largely bloodless, if Livy's account is to be trusted. The royal
family was expelled from the city, and two consuls were immediately
elected to govern the newly formed Republic. Or so, again, Livy tells
us, based on Roman legend. The reality is likely to have been more
complicated. Assuming there truly were seven kings who ruled the city,
and assuming that the last of them was driven out by an aristocratic
revolution, it appears that a period of transition ensued, as the Romans
experimented with a variety of short-term solutions before arriving at
the model of the Republican government that we know in the historical
period. Furthermore, the gradual evolution of the government was likely
guided by the dissatisfaction of the plebians, the lower socio-economic
majority of the city who were excluded from the political process.

## 6.8.2 Early Republic: Conflict of Orders, the Twelve Tables, and Key Legislations {.import-Header3}

Roman sources from all periods, beginning in the early Republic, reveal
certain common values that Romans considered to be foundational for
their state. First, Romans had a strong respect for the past and were
averse to change. Indeed, reformers had a difficult time passing their
proposals in all periods of Roman history. The term for this reverence
for the past, ***mos*** ***maiorum***, "custom of ancestors" or "custom
of elders," is telling. While innovation is a revered value in the
modern world, Romans believed that innovation amounted to disrespect for
their ancestors. Ancestral custom, which first made Rome great, had to
be respected. Successful reformers managed to phrase their reforms as a
return to something old, rather than as something new. Three additional
values that are key to understanding the Romans are *auctoritas*,
"power" or "authority;" *dignitas*, roughly meaning "dignity;" and
*gravitas*, "seriousness." Each citizen in the state had a degree of
*auctoritas*, that intangible quality that made others obey, but the
degree of *auctoritas* varied, depending on one's social and political
standing. Augustus, Rome's first emperor, would later describe his
position in the state as having more *auctoritas* than anyone else. The
other two qualities, *dignitas* and *gravitas*, were connected and
reflected one's bearing and behavior as a true Roman. Jocularity was not
valued, but seriousness reflected a particularly Roman conduct and
determination. It is striking that Romans never smiled in portraits. The
austere facial expression, instead, conveyed their power and superiority
to others, whom they had conquered.

Romans were also deeply aware of social divisions between themselves.
From its earliest time, the Roman citizen population was divided into
two orders: the **patricians**, defined as the descendants from the
first one hundred senators appointed to the Roman aristocratic Senate by
King Romulus, and the **plebeians**---that is, everyone who was not a
patrician. The plebeians had their own political assembly, the
**Plebeian Council**, while all Roman citizens also belonged to the
**Centuriate** **Assembly**, which was responsible for annual elections
for top political offices. The period of the early Republic, following
the expulsion of the kings, was a time of conflict for the two orders.
Patricians tried to establish a government that reserved all political
power to themselves, whereas the plebeians fought for the opportunity to
hold political and religious offices. Although Plebians did not wield
any political power at first, they discovered in the fifth century that
their most powerful weapon was secession---that is, departure en masse
from the city---until the patricians acquiesced to a demand. While much
about the **Conflict of the Orders** is shrouded in legend, it is
possible to track its progress through Roman legislation.

In 494 BCE, following the first plebeian secession, the Roman Senate
allowed the plebeians to elect plebeian tribunes to advocate for them.
Plebeians next appear to have advocated for a public display of the laws
in order to protect the poor during lawsuits. The result was the first
Roman legal code, the **Twelve Tables**, which was inscribed on twelve
tables c. 450 BCE and displayed in public. One of the laws included was
a ban on intermarriage between plebeians and patricians, showing a clear
commitment on the part of the patricians to maintain the separation of
the orders. Many patrician families eventually intermarried with
prominent plebeian families, though, as the number patrician families
declined over time.

The highest political office in the Republic, that of the consul,
continued to be reserved solely for patricians until 367 BCE, when two
senators sponsored the Licinian-Sextian law. The law required that one
of the two consuls elected each year had to be plebeian. The phrasing of
the law was significant, as it allowed the possibility that both consuls
elected in a particular year could be plebeian, although this did not
happen until 215 BCE. Finally, the legislation that modern historians
have considered to have ended the early Republican Conflict of the
Orders is the Lex Hortensia of 287 BCE. This law made all legislation
passed by the Plebeian Council binding on all Romans, patricians and
plebeians alike.

As historians connect the dots in the story of the Conflict of the
Orders, one trend that emerges is the gradual weakening of the
patricians along with the growing influence of the plebeians on Roman
government. Indeed, by the third century, some plebeian families were as
wealthy and successful as patrician families, whereas some patrician
families had fallen on hard times.

## 6.8.3 Cursus Honorum and Roman Religion {.import-Header3}

The debate over plebeian access to political offices in general, and to
the consulship in particular, resulted in the creation of a rigid
***cursus*** ***honorum***, a sequence or ladder of political offices.
The ultimate dream of every Roman who entered politics was to become a
consul, but the narrowing pyramid that was the *cursus* *honorum* stood
in his path. All offices were held for the term of one year, and in
order to prevent any one individual from amassing too much power,
candidates had to wait ten years between consulships. Finally, each
office had a minimum age requirement, with a special privilege for
patricians to subtract two years from that minimum.

The prerequisite for holding any political office was ten years of
military service. Thus, aspiring Roman politicians normally entered the
army around eighteen years of age. Following ten years of distinguished
service, candidates who were at least thirty years of age were allowed
to run for the first office in the *cursus*: the quaestorship. The
number of quaestors each year rose over time to twenty by the late
Republic. Each quaestor was assigned to a particular duty for his year
in office, varying from supervising the coin mint in Rome to serving as
an assistant to a provincial governor or a consul in charge of a war.

While not officially part of the required *cursus*, most ex-quaestors
next ran for the office of the **plebeian tribune**, if they were
plebeian, or an aedile. Ten plebeian tribunes were elected each year and
were supposed to advocate for the benefit of the plebeians during
senatorial debates. Aediles---a term derived from the Latin "aedes,"
meaning "building" or "temple"---were in charge of public building
projects and entertainment.

The next step in the *cursus* was the praetorship. Like the quaestors,
the number of praetors rose over time, until reaching eight in the late
Republic. Praetors could hold *imperium*, the right to command an army;
thus, they often served in military roles or in administrative capacity
by governing a province. Finally, one praetor each year, the *praetor*
*urbanus*, was responsible for administering justice in the city of Rome
and keeping track of legal cases and important decisions, which he
issued at the end of the year as the Praetor's Edict.

Upon reaching the age of forty, candidates who had successfully held the
praetorship could run for **consul**. Two consuls were elected annually,
and this position was the pinnacle of the Roman political career.
Aristocratic families kept for centuries on display in their homes the
ancestor masks of members of the family who had been consuls. Since ten
years were required to elapse between successive consulships, very few
individuals ever held more than one consulship, until several
politicians in the late Republic broke the rules altogether. One
additional office existed, for which ex-consuls could run: every five
years, two censors were elected for the purpose of conducting the census
of citizens.

While this structure of annually-elected offices was designed to prevent
any one individual from usurping all political power in the state, the
Senate also realized that, on rare occasions, concentrating all power in
one set of hands was needed. Thus the Senate could appoint a dictator
for a non-renewable period of six months in times of serious military
emergency, such as in the already-mentioned case of Cincinnatus.

The *cursus* *honorum* is best visualized as a pyramid with a wide base
and narrowing each step on the way up. While twenty men each year were
elected to the quaestorship, only a fraction of them could ever achieve
the praetorship, and a yet smaller fraction could rise to the
consulship. Still, election to the quaestorship secured life-long
membership in the **Senate**, the governing body of roughly 300
politicians (later 600) who effectively governed Rome under the
Republic. The question remains, nevertheless: how did some men achieve
political advancement while others never made it past the quaestorship?
Part of the key to success, it appears, lay outside of politics proper,
belonging instead to the realm of religion.

Roman religion, like Greek, was traditionally polytheistic, with many
myths and gods aligned to the Greek counterparts. Zeus, Greek king of
the gods, became Jupiter and was a patron god of Rome under the title
**Jupiter Optimus Maximus**, or Jupiter the Best and the Greatest.

His consort, Hera, became the Roman goddess **Juno** and was the patron
goddess of marriage. The Greek Athena became Roman **Minerva** and was
the patron divinity of women's crafts. In addition, both **Venus**, the
goddess of love, and **Mars**, the god of war, had mythical family
connections to Rome's human founders. Countless other divinities
abounded as well; even the Roman sewer system, Cloaca Maxima, had its
own patron goddess, Cloacina.

While Romans were expected to worship some of the gods in private, often
making vows to them and promising gifts if the gods fulfilled a request,
Roman religion also had a significant public component that was reserved
for the priestly colleges. Although not limited to politicians,
membership in these colleges was at times key for political advancement.
One example of this is Julius Caesar, whose political career took off
after his appointment to the religious office of ***pontifex maximus***,
head of Roman religion. Ultimately, both public and private religion
aimed at the same goal: keeping the *pax* *deorum*, or peace with the
gods. Romans believed the success of the state rested on this principle.
Whenever any disasters befell the state, Romans assumed that *pax*
*deorum* had been violated in some way. The gods then had to be appeased
to end the disaster and prevent similar events from occurring in the
future.

## 6.8.4 Roman Expansion to the End of the Punic Wars {.import-Header3}

While the legends about the kings of Rome suggest that they had
significant military responsibilities, it appears that their military
actions were largely defensive. Just a decade or so after the expulsion
of the kings, shortly after 500 BCE, however, Roman expansion began in
earnest. It is important to note here several key features of the early
Roman military. First, until the late Republic, Rome did not maintain a
standing army. Rather, a new army was raised for each campaign, and
campaigns were typically launched in the spring and ended in the fall.
The festival of the October Horse, one of the religious festivals the
Romans celebrated each year, involved a ritual purification of the
cavalry. It was likely designed as the end point of the campaign season.
Like the Greeks, the Romans had minimum wealth requirements for military
service, since soldiers supplied their own equipment. Finally, one
significant trend to note in early Republican military history is the
repeated nature of Roman conflicts with the same enemies, such as the
three Samnite Wars, the three **Punic Wars**, and the four Macedonian
Wars. This repetition suggests that, for whatever reason, the Romans did
not aim to annihilate their opponents, unless absolutely pressed to do
so.

It appears that Roman expansion in the 490s BCE began as a defensive
measure. The expelled seventh king of Rome, Tarquin the Proud, joined
forces with the Latin League, a group of about thirty city-states around
the area of Rome, and led them to attack the Romans. The result was the
Battle of Lake Regillus, a decisive victory for Rome. The Romans signed
an uneasy peace treaty with the Latins, but war broke out again in
340--338 BCE. The Roman victory this time resulted in the absorption of
the Latin city-states into Rome as partial citizens.

The Latins were not the only enemies the nascent Roman Republic had to
face. Romans fought and gradually conquered the Etruscan city-states to
the north. One especially significant victory was over the powerful
Etruscan city of Veii in 396 BCE. A legend preserved by Livy states that
Romans were only able to conquer Veii after they performed the ceremony
of *evocation*, "calling out." Fearing that their siege of Veii was not
going well because Juno, the patron goddess of Veii, was not on their
side, the Romans called Juno out of Veii; they promised her a nice new
temple in Rome if she would switch sides. Shortly thereafter, the city
fell to the Romans. When the Roman soldiers were packing up the cult
statue of Juno from her temple in Veii for transportation to Rome, a
cheeky Roman soldier asked Juno if she wanted to come to Rome. The
statue enthusiastically nodded her head. Livy's history is full of
similar tales of divine providence intervening on the side of the
Romans. These legends demonstrate the Romans' own belief that the gods
had protected them and guided their expansion.

</figure>

While still fighting the Latins, the Romans embarked upon what turned
out to be a series of three wars with their neighbors to the east, the
Samnites. Each of these wars, the last of which ended in 290 BCE,
resulted in Roman territorial gains; by the end of the Third Samnite
War, Rome controlled all of central Italy. It also appears that at some
point during the Samnite Wars, the Romans switched from fighting in the
Greek hoplite phalanx fashion to a system of their own making, the
manipular legion. This new system apparently allowed more flexibility in
the arrangement of the troops on the battlefield; it also allowed using
both heavy and light infantry as needed, instead of keeping them in a
static formation for the duration of a battle. While not much else is
known about the manipular legion, it appears to have been an effective
system for the Romans for much of the Republican period.

It is striking to consider that the Romans spent eighty of the hundred
years in the third century BCE at war. They did not seem to have had the
ambition to conquer the Greek city-states who were their neighbors in
southern Italy. In 280--275 BCE, though, Rome became embroiled in a war
with Pyrrhus, king of Epirus in northern Greece, after providing help to
Thurii in its dispute with Tarentum in Italy. Tarentum requested
Pyrrhus' help, and he proceeded to invade Italy. The Romans fought three
major battles against Pyrrhus, the first two of which he won at great
cost to his army. Indeed, the term "**Pyrrhic victory**" in modern
English refers to a victory that is so costly as to be truly a loss. The
Romans finally defeated Pyrrhus at a third battle in 275 BCE, showing
the superiority of the new Roman manipular legion even against the
phalanx of the Macedonians, military descendants of Alexander the Great
himself. This victory united most of Italy under Roman rule.

The war with Pyrrhus was the Romans' first serious conflict with the
Greek world, but it was far from their last. The Romans' proximity to
northern Greece ensured an intersection of spheres of interest, thus
also providing cause for continued conflict. Between 214 and 148 BCE,
Rome fought four separate Macedonian Wars. During roughly the same
period, from 264 to 146 BCE, the Romans also fought three Punic Wars
against **Carthage**, originally a Phoenician colony that became a
leading maritime power. In 146 BCE, Rome destroyed both Carthage (in
North Africa) and Corinth (in Greece). Victory over both powers
effectively put the entire Mediterranean world under Roman rule.

In 146 BCE, when the Romans found themselves in control of an empire,
they appeared to foresee little of the consequences of such a rapid
expansion on internal stability. A critical question nevertheless faced
them: how would the Republic, whose system of government was designed
for a small city-state, adapt to ruling a large empire? The preliminary
answer on which the Romans settled was to divide the conquered
territories into provinces, to which senatorial governors were assigned
for terms that varied from one to five years. The system continued, with
minor variations, into the Empire.

The new availability of governor positions, however, made political
competition in the Republic even stiffer than before. Senators competed
for the most desirable positions. Typically, these were provinces in
which military action was on-going---since this provided the potential
for winning military glory---or provinces that were wealthy, since this
provided governors an opportunity to acquire personal wealth.

## 6.9 FALL OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC

The victory over Carthage in the Second Punic War allowed Rome to
"close" the circle of the Mediterranean almost completely, acquiring
control over all territories that had previously belonged to Carthage.
The destruction of Carthage in the Third Punic War, while largely a
symbolic gesture, further cemented Rome's control over the entire
Mediterranean. The late Republican historian Sallust, though, grimly saw
the Roman victory in the Punic Wars as the beginning of the end of the
Republic. As Sallust and some other conservative politicians of his day
believed, this victory corrupted the noble Roman character,
traditionally steeled by privation. More importantly, the abundance of
resources that flowed in following the victories over Carthage raised
the question of distribution of this new wealth and land. Disagreements
over this question dominated the politics of the late Republic, creating
two new political factions: the ***Populares***, or those who protected
the interests of the people, and the ***Optimates***, or those who
protected the interests of the best element of the populace---namely,
themselves.

### 6.9.1 The Gracchi and the Beginning of Political Violence

It is striking to consider that political violence was minimal in the
Roman Republic until 133 BCE. Indeed, if the legends are true, even the
expulsion of the kings in 510 BCE was a bloodless event. Starting with
133 BCE, however, the final century of the Roman Republic was defined by
political violence and civil war.

In 133 BCE, **Tiberius Gracchus** was one of the ten annually elected
plebeian tribunes. He was a scion on his mother's side of one of the
oldest and most respected families in Rome, the Cornelii Scipiones.
Alarmed that the lands acquired through recent Roman conquests had
largely been taken over by rich landowners, Gracchus proposed a land
distribution law, known as the *Lex* *Sempronia* *Agraria*. Gracchus
argued that land redistribution would benefit the state, since
land-ownership was a pre-requisite for military service. Aware that the
Senate's Optimates faction opposed his proposal, Gracchus took his law
directly to the Plebeian Council, which passed it. This measure resulted
in escalating conflict between Gracchus and the rest of the Senate. At a
meeting of the Senate, the *pontifex maximus*, who was Tiberius
Gracchus' own cousin, argued that Gracchus had attempted to make himself
king; thus, he had to be stopped. Since weapons were banned inside the
Senate building, enraged Senators grabbed whatever was on hand,
including chair and table legs, and clubbed Gracchus to death. As the
biographer Plutarch states, this was the first instance of civic strife
of this kind in ancient Rome.

The death of Tiberius Gracchus also meant the death of his proposed law.
Ten years later, however, Gracchus' proposed reforms gained a second
life in the hands of his younger brother, **Gaius** **Gracchus**, who
was elected plebeian tribune in 123 BCE and served a second term in that
office in 122 BCE. Gaius Gracchus' agrarian reform proposal was even
more ambitious than his brother's. Especially controversial was Gaius
Gracchus' proposal of granting full Roman citizenship to Rome's Italian
allies. Finally, in 121 BCE, alarmed at Gaius Gracchus' popularity with
the people, the consul Lucius Opimius proposed a new measure in the
Senate: a *senatus* *consultum* *ultimum*, or the final decree of the
Senate, which amounted to allowing the consuls to do whatever was
necessary to safeguard the state. Realizing that the passing of this law
amounted to his death sentence, Gaius Gracchus committed suicide.

The proposed reforms of Gaius Gracchus were overturned after his death,
but the legacy of the Gracchi for the Roman Republic cannot be
underestimated. First, their proposed laws showed the growing conflict
between the rich and the poor in the Roman state. Second, the
willingness on the part of prominent Senators to resort to violence to
resolve matters set a dangerous precedent for the remainder of the
Republic and fundamentally changed the nature of Roman politics.
Finally, the support that the Gracchi received from the Roman people, as
well as the residents of Italian cities who were not full citizens,
showed that the causes that the Gracchi adopted were not going to go
away after their death. Indeed, Rome's Italian allies went to war
against Rome in 90--88 BCE; the result of this **Social War**, after
"socii," meaning "allies," was the grant of full Roman citizenship
rights to Italians.

### 6.9.2 The Civil War of Marius and Sulla and the Conspiracy of Catilina

The affair of the Gracchi was the first clear instance in the late
Republic of Populares and Optimates in a violent conflict. Decades
later, a conflict between two politicians representing different sides
in this debate resulted in a full-fledged civil war.

In 107 BCE, impatient over the prolonged and challenging war against the
Numidian king Jugurtha, the Romans elected as consul Gaius **Marius**.

While Marius had already enjoyed a distinguished military career, he was
a *novus* *homo,* or "new man." This was a term the Romans used to refer
to newcomers to Roman politics, meaning individuals who have not had any
family members elected to political office. Even more shockingly, Marius
was not even from Rome proper but from the town of Arpinum, located
sixty miles south of Rome. Marius benefited from the sense of
frustration in Rome over the length of the war and the perceived
corruption of the aristocratic leaders abroad. Once elected, he took
over the command in the war and passed comprehensive reforms to the
Roman military. First, Marius abolished the property requirement for
military service, allowing landless Romans to serve in the army for the
first time. A second and related change was a new commitment on the part
of the Roman state to arm its troops and pay them for service.
Henceforth, the military became a profession, rather than a seasonal
occupation for farmers. Finally, Marius changed the tactics of the
legionary organization on the battlefield, changing the legion of
maniples into a legion of cohorts.

Marius' reforms, while controversial, proved immensely successful, and
he swiftly defeated Jugurtha, ending the war in 104 BCE. As a result of
his victories, Marius gained unprecedented popularity in Rome and was
elected to five more successive consulships in 104--100 BCE. While a law
existed requiring ten years between successive consulships, Marius'
popularity and military success, in conjunction with the Romans' fear of
on-going foreign wars, elevated him above the law. While Marius began
his military career fighting for Rome, though, he ended it by causing
the worst civil war Rome had seen to that point.

In 88 BCE, the Roman Senate was facing a war against Mithridates, king
of Pontus, who had long been a thorn in Rome's side in the Eastern
provinces of the empire. Sensing that Marius was too old to undertake
the war, the Senate appointed Lucius Cornelius **Sulla**, a
distinguished general who had started his career as Marius' quaestor in
the Jugurthine War and was now a consul himself. Marius, however, had
another trick up his sleeve. Summoning the Plebeian Council, Marius
overturned the decision of the Senate and drove Sulla out of Rome.
Instead of going lightly into exile, Sulla gathered an army and marched
on Rome---the first time in Roman history that a Roman general led a
Roman army against Rome!

</figure>

Sulla took over Rome, swiftly had himself declared commander of the war
on Mithridates, and departed for the Black Sea. In 86 BCE, Marius was
elected consul for the seventh and final time in his career, then
promptly died of natural causes, just seventeen days after taking
office. The civil war that he started with Sulla, though, was still far
from over.

In 83 BCE, victorious over Mithridates but facing a hostile reception
from the Senate, Sulla marched on Rome for the second time. This time,
he meant business. Declaring himself dictator for reforming the Roman
constitution, Sulla ruled Rome as a dictator for the next three years.
His reforms aimed to prevent the rise of another Marius and
significantly curtailed the powers of the plebeian tribunes. In
addition, he established the proscriptions---a list of enemies of the
state, whom anyone could kill on sight and whose property was
confiscated. Incidentally, one name on Sulla's list was the young
**Julius Caesar**, whose aunt had been married to Gaius Marius. While
Caesar obviously survived the proscription, and went on to become a
prominent politician himself, the confiscation of his property by Sulla
ensured that he remained painfully strapped financially and in debt for
the rest of his life.

After enacting his reforms, Sulla just as suddenly resigned from
politics, retiring to a family estate outside of Rome in 79 BCE, where
he appears to have drunk himself into an early grave. Over the next
several decades, some of Sulla's reforms were overturned, such as those
pertaining to the plebeian tribunes. Most historians of the Republic
agree, however, that the Republican constitution never reverted to its
old state. The Republic after Sulla was a different Republic than before
him.

The civil war of Marius and Sulla showed the increasingly greater degree
of competition in the Republic as well as the lengths to which some
Roman politicians were willing to go to get power and hold on to it.
Furthermore, it demonstrated one dangerous side effect of Marius'
military reforms. Before Marius, Roman farmer-soldiers did not feel a
personal affinity for their generals. After Marius' reforms, however,
soldiers were paid by their generals. Their loyalty was to their
generals, as much or more than to the Roman state. Finally, Marius'
incredible political success---election to a record-setting and
law-breaking seven consulships over the course of his life---showed that
military ability had somewhat leveled the playing field between old
patrician families such as Sulla's and newcomers to Roman politics. This
was an especially bitter pill to swallow for some patricians.

In 63 BCE, Lucius Sergius **Catilina**, a patrician who had
unsuccessfully run for consulship and who was defeated that very year by
another newcomer from Arpinum, Marcus Tullius Cicero, conspired with
other frustrated Senators to assassinate the consuls and take over the
state. Catilina's conspiracy failed, and modern historians can read
Cicero's own reports to the Senate and the people about how he
discovered and stopped this conspiracy. Catilina's frustration, like
that of Sulla twenty years earlier, nevertheless shows how difficult it
was for "old-school" political families to accept new competition for
the consulship. Catilina's plan also shows just how quickly political
violence became the "normal" solution to problems in Rome after the
Gracchi.

### 6.9.3 The First Triumvirate and the Civil War of Caesar and Pompey

The political careers of Marius and Sulla, as well as Catilina, show the
increased level of competition in the late Republic and the ruthlessness
with which some Roman politicians attempted to gain the consulship. In
60 BCE, however, a group of three politicians tried to achieve its goals
by doing something atypical of Roman politicians: they formed an
alliance. The alliance even transcended the usual division of Populares
and Optimates, showing that, for these three men at least, the thirst
for political power was more important than any other personal
convictions.

Marcus Licinius **Crassus** was the wealthiest man in Rome, son of a
consul, and consul himself in 70 BCE. His colleague in the consulship in
70 BCE, Gnaeus **Pompey**, achieved military fame in his youth, earning
him the nickname "Magnus," or "the Great," from Sulla himself.

</figure>

By 60 BCE, however, both Crassus and Pompey felt frustrated with their
political careers. They joined forces with a relative newcomer to the
world of politics, Gaius Julius Caesar. The three men formed an
alliance, secret at first, which Cicero later dubbed the
**Triumvirate**. To cement the alliance, Caesar's daughter, Julia,
married Pompey. Together, they lobbied to help each other rise again to
the consulship and achieve desirable military commands.

The alliance paid immediate dividends for Caesar, who was promptly
elected consul for 59 BCE and was then awarded Gaul as his province for
five years after the consulship. Crassus and Pompey, in the meanwhile,
were re-elected consuls for 55 BCE, and in the same year, Caesar's
command in Gaul was renewed for another five years. The renewal did not
specify whether the five-year clock started afresh in 55 BCE---in which
case, Caesar's command was to end in 50 BCE---or if the five years were
added to the original five-year term---in which case, Caesar's command
would have ended in 48 BCE.

A talented writer, as well as skilled general, Caesar made sure to
publish an account of his Gallic campaigns in installments during his
time in Gaul. As a result, Romans were continually aware of Caesar's
successes, and his popularity actually grew in his absence. His rising
popularity was a source of frustration for the other two triumvirs.
Finally, the already uneasy alliance disintegrated in 53 BCE. First,
Julia died in childbirth, and her baby died with her. In the same year,
Crassus was killed at the Battle of Carrhae, fighting the Parthians.
With the death of both Julia and Crassus, no links were left connecting
Caesar and Pompey; the two former family relations, albeit by marriage,
swiftly became enemies.

Late in 50 BCE, the Senate, under the leadership of Pompey, informed
Caesar that his command had expired and demanded that he surrender his
army. Caesar, however, refused to return to Rome as a private citizen,
demanding to be allowed to stand for the consulship *in absentia*. When
his demands were refused, Caesar and his army crossed the Rubicon, a
river which marked the border of his province. By leaving his province
with his army against the wishes of the Senate, Caesar committed an act
of treason, as defined in Roman law; the civil war began.

While most of the Senate was on Pompey's side, Caesar started the war
with a distinct advantage: his troops had just spent the larger part of
a decade fighting with him in Gaul. Pompey's army, on the other hand,
was disorganized. As a result, for much of 49 BCE, Pompey retreated to
the south of Italy, with Caesar in pursuit. Finally, in late 48 BCE, the
two fought a decisive battle at Pharsalus in northern Greece. There,
Caesar's army managed to defeat Pompey's much larger forces. After the
defeat, Pompey fled to Egypt, where he was assassinated by order of
Ptolemy XIII, who had hoped to win Caesar's favor by this action. When
he arrived in Egypt in pursuit of Pompey, however, Caesar sided with
Ptolemy's sister **Cleopatra VII** and appears to have fathered a son
with her, Caesarion.

### 6.9.4 Aftermath of the Civil War, the Second Triumvirate, and the Age of Augustus

Victorious in the civil war against Pompey and his supporters, Caesar
was faced with the challenging question of what to do next. Clearly, he
was planning to hold on to power in some way. Based on previous history,
there were two options available to him: the Marius model of rule,
meaning election to successive consulships, and the Sulla model, meaning
dictatorship. Initially, Caesar followed the first model, holding the
consulship with a colleague in 47 BCE and 46 BCE, then serving as sole
consul in 45 BCE. By early 44 BCE, however, Caesar appears to have
decided to adopt the Sulla model instead. In February of 44 BCE, he took
the title of *dictator* *perpetuo*, or "dictator for life," and had
coins minted with his image and new title. This was the first instance
in Roman history of a living individual placing their likeness on
coinage.

This new title appears to have been the final straw for a group of about
sixty senators who feared that Caesar aimed to make himself a king. On
the Ides of March (March 15th) of 44 BCE, the conspirators rushed Caesar
during a Senate meeting and stabbed him to death. But if the
conspirators had thought that by assassinating Caesar they were going to
restore the Republic, they turned out to be sorely mistaken.

:::: __UNKNOWN__
Caesar's will, in which he left money to each resident of the city of
Rome and donated his gardens for use by the public, only further
increased his popularity among the people, and popular rioting ensued
throughout the city. Since Caesar did not have legitimate sons who could
inherit---his son with Cleopatra was illegitimate---he adopted an heir
in his will, a common Roman practice. The heir in question was his
grand-nephew Gaius Octavius, whose name after the adoption became Gaius
Julius Caesar Octavianus (or Octavian, in English). It is interesting to
note that Caesar's will also named a back-up heir, in case the main heir
would have died before inheriting. The back-up heir was none other than
Brutus, one of Caesar's assassins.

At the time of his adoption as Caesar's heir, Octavian was nineteen
years old; thus, he was too young to have had much military or political
experience. Quickly, though, he showed political acumen, initially using
an alliance with two much more experienced former allies of Caesar:
**Marcus** **Antonius** and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Forming what became
known as the **Second Triumvirate**, the three men renewed the
proscriptions in 43 BCE, aggressively pursuing the enemies of Caesar.
The triumvirs defeated Caesar's assassins at the Battle of Philippi in
northern Greece in 42 BCE; they then carved the Roman world into regions
to be ruled by each. Marcus Antonius, who claimed Egypt, although it was
not yet a Roman province, proceeded to marry Cleopatra and rule Egypt
with her over the following decade. Ultimately, however, another civil
war resulted between Antonius and Octavian, with the latter winning a
decisive victory in the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. From that moment
until his death in 14 CE, Octavian---soon to be named **Augustus** in 27
BCE---ruled what henceforth was known as the Roman Empire.

While modern historians refer to Augustus as the first emperor of Rome,
that is not the title that he himself had, nor would he have said that
he was creating a new form of government. Rather, throughout his time in
power, Augustus claimed to have restored the Roman Republic, and with
the exception of a few elected offices, he did not have any official
position. How did he manage to rule the Roman Empire for over forty
years without any official position? Some answers can be found in the
*Res Gestae Divi* *Augusti*, an autobiography that Augustus himself
composed in the year before he died and which he ordered to be posted on
his Mausoleum in Rome, with copies also posted in all major cities
throughout the Empire.

Reflecting on his forty-year rule, Augustus described himself as the
first citizen, or *princeps*, of the Roman state, superior to others in
his *auctoritas*. In addition, he was especially proud of the title of
"Pater Patriae," or "Father of the Fatherland," voted to him by the
Senate and reflecting his status as the patron of all citizens. It is
striking to consider that other than these honorary titles and
positions, Augustus did not have an official position as a ruler.
Indeed, having learned from Caesar's example, he avoided accepting any
titles that might have smacked of a desire for kingship. Instead, he
brilliantly created for himself new titles and powers, thoroughly
grounded in previous Republican tradition. In addition, he proved to be
a master diplomat, who shared power with the Senate in a way beneficial
to himself, and by all of these actions seamlessly married the entire
Republican political structure with one-man rule.

While the political structure of the Roman Republic in its final century
of existence was increasingly unstable, entertainment culture and
literary arts flourished in Rome. Although much of Roman literary
culture was based on Greek literature, the Romans adapted what they
borrowed to make it distinctly their own. While adapting Greek tragedies
and comedies and, in some cases, apparently translating them wholesale,
Romans still injected Roman values into them, thus making them relatable
to republican audiences. Similarly, while Roman philosophy and rhetoric
of the Republic were heavily based on their Greek counterparts, their
writers thoroughly Romanized the concepts discussed, as well as the
presentation. For instance, Cicero, a preeminent rhetorician and
philosopher of the late Republic, adapted the model of the Socratic
dialogue in several of his philosophical treatises to make dialogues
between prominent Romans of the Middle Republic. His *De* *Republica*, a
work expressly modeled on Plato's *Republic*, features Scipio
Aemilianus, the victor over Carthage in the Third Punic War.

While the late Republic was a period of growth for Roman literary arts,
with much of the writing done by politicians, the age of Augustus saw an
even greater flourishing of Roman literature. This increase was due in
large part to Augustus' own investment in sponsoring prominent poets to
write about the greatness of Rome. The three most prominent poets of the
Augustan age---Virgil, Horace, and Ovid---all wrote poetry glorifying
Augustan Rome. Virgil's *Aeneid*, finished in 19 BCE, aimed to be the
Roman national epic and indeed achieved that goal. The epic, intended to
be the Roman version of Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey* combined,
describes the travels of the Trojan prince Aeneas who, by will of the
gods, became the founder of Rome. Clearly connecting the Roman to the
Greek heroic tradition, the epic also includes a myth explaining the
origins of the Punic Wars: during his travels, before he arrived in
Italy, Aeneas was ship-wrecked and landed in Carthage. Dido, the queen
of Carthage, fell in love with him and wanted him to stay with her, but
the gods ordered Aeneas to sail on to Italy. After Aeneas abandoned her,
Dido committed suicide and cursed the future Romans to be at war with
her people.

The works of Horace and Ovid were more humorous at times, but they still
included significant elements from early Roman myths. They showcased the
*pax* *deorum* that caused Rome to flourish in the past and, again now,
in the age of Augustus. Ovid appears to have pushed the envelope beyond
acceptable limits, whether in his poetry or in his personal conduct.
Therefore, Augustus exiled him in 8 CE to the city of Tomis on the Black
Sea, where Ovid spent the remainder of his life writing mournful poetry
and begging unsuccessfully to be recalled to Rome.

In addition to sponsoring literature, the age of Augustus was a time of
building and rebuilding around Rome. In his *Res Gestae*, Augustus
includes a very long list of temples that he had restored or built.
These building projects stood as symbols of renewal and prosperity
ordained by the gods themselves. One famous example is the *Ara*
*Pacis*, or Altar of Peace, in Rome. The altar features mythological
scenes and processions of gods; it also integrates scenes of the
imperial family, including Augustus himself making a sacrifice to the
gods while flanked by his grandsons Gaius and Lucius.

The message of these building projects, as well as the other arts that
Augustus sponsored, is simple: Augustus wanted to show that his rule was
a new Golden Age of Roman history, a time when peace was restored and
Rome flourished, truly blessed by the gods.

## 6.10 THE EARLY EMPIRE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The period from the consolidation of power by Augustus in 27 BCE to the
death of the emperor Marcus Aurelius in 180 CE was one of relative peace
and prosperity throughout the Roman Empire. For this reason, the Romans
themselves referred to this time as the ***Pax Romana***, or Roman
peace. During this period, the Empire grew to its largest extent. Of
course, some Roman subjects did not welcome Roman conquest. The Roman
historian Tacitus narrates a speech of a British tribal rebel leader,
Calgacus, to his men before they fought---and were defeated by---the
Romans in 85 CE: "they (the Romans) make a desert, and call it peace."
Other evidence from the territories in the periphery of the Empire also
shows that Romanization was not absolute, as some remote rural areas in
provinces far from Italy did not really feel the impact of the Empire.
Finally, the period of the early Empire witnessed the rise of a new
religion, **Christianity**. This new religion did not have a profound
impact on the state yet at this point, but the seeds planted in this
period allowed for fundamental changes to occur centuries later. This
is, after all, one of the marvels of history. It can take centuries to
see the long-term impact of events that seem so small and insignificant
at first.

### 6.10.1 The Julio-Claudian Dynasty

The historian Tacitus describes in detail the emotions in the Roman
Senate upon the death of Augustus. Some Senators were hoping for the
return of the Republic, while others assumed that Augustus' stepson
would inherit his nebulous yet amazingly powerful position. The scales
were heavily weighed in favor of the latter. As Tacitus points out, most
Senators by 14 CE---fifty years after Caesar's assassination---had never
lived under a Republic; thus, they did not really know what a true
Republic looked like. Still, the question that all were pondering in 14
CE was: how do you pass on something that does not exist? After all,
Augustus did not have any official position. The first succession was a
test case to see if the imperial system of government would become the
new normal for Rome.

Augustus himself seems to have been worried about appointing a successor
for his entire time in power. Because of untimely deaths of all other
possible candidates, Augustus eventually settled on adopting his stepson
**Tiberius** Claudius Nero (not to be confused with the later emperor
Nero). Over the final years of his life, Augustus gradually shared more
of his unofficial powers with Tiberius in order to smooth the process of
succession. Augustus' plan appears to have worked. After a brief
conversation in the Senate, the Senators conferred upon Tiberius all of
Augustus' previous powers. Tiberius' succession is the reason historians
refer to the first Roman imperial dynasty as the **Julio-Claudians**.

Tiberius, a decorated military general in his youth, appears in our
sources as a sullen and possibly cruel individual, whose temperament
made Augustus himself feel sorry for leaving such a ruler in his
stead---or so Suetonius tells us.

He also appears to have been a rather reluctant emperor, who much
preferred life out of the public eye. Finally, in 26 CE, Tiberius
retired to Capri for the final eleven years of his rule. It is a
testament to the spectacular bureaucratic system that was the Roman
Empire that the eleven-year absence of the emperor was hardly felt, one
exception being a foiled plot against Tiberius by his chief trusted
advisor in Rome, Sejanus.

Like Augustus, Tiberius had a difficult time selecting a successor; each
relative who was identified as a candidate died an untimely death.
Ultimately, Tiberius adopted as his successor his grandnephew Gaius
**Caligula**, or "little boot," son of the popular military hero
Germanicus.

While Caligula began his rule with full support of both the people and
the Senate, and with an unprecedented degree of popularity, he swiftly
proved to be mentally unstable and bankrupted the state in under four
years. In 41 CE, he was assassinated by three disgruntled officers in
the Praetorian Guard, which ironically was responsible for protecting
the emperor. Caligula's assassination left Rome in disarray.

The biographer Suetonius reports that while the confused Senate was
meeting and planning to declare the restoration of the Roman Republic,
the Praetorian Guard proclaimed as the next emperor **Claudius**, uncle
of Caligula and the brother of Germanicus.

While Claudius was a member of the imperial family, he was never
considered a candidate for succession before. He had a speech
impediment; as a result, Augustus considered him an embarrassment to the
imperial family. Claudius proved to be a productive emperor, but he
repeatedly weathered plots against his life by first one wife and then
the next. Finally, in 54 CE, Claudius died. He was widely believed to
have been poisoned by his wife, Agrippina the Younger. Since the cause,
as Suetonius tells us, was mushrooms, a popular joke thereafter in Rome
was that mushrooms were the food of the gods---a reference to the
deification of most emperors after their death.

Although Claudius had a biological son from an earlier marriage, that
son was poisoned soon after his death. His successor instead became
**Nero**, his stepson, who was only sixteen years old when he gained
power.

</figure>

Showing the danger of inexperience for an emperor, Nero gradually
alienated the Senate, the people, and the army over the course of his
fourteen-year rule. He destroyed his own reputation by performing on
stage---behavior that was considered disgraceful in Roman society.
Furthermore, Nero is believed in 64 CE to have caused the great fire of
Rome in order to free up space in the middle of the city for his
ambitious new palace, the Domus Aurea, or Golden House.

The last years of Nero's reign were characterized by provincial
rebellions. A revolt broke out in Judea in 66 CE. The governor of Gaul,
Gaius Julius Vindex, also rebelled against Nero. The revolt of Vindex
proved to be the end of Nero. Vindex convinced the governor of Spain,
Servius Sulpicius Galba, to join the rebellion and, furthermore,
proclaim himself emperor. While the rebellion of Vindex was quickly
squashed, and Vindex himself committed suicide, popular support for
Galba grew just as quickly. Finally, terrified by rumors of Galba
marching to Rome, Nero committed suicide in June of 68 CE. His death
marked the end of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty.

### 6.10.2 The Year of the Four Emperors, the Flavian Dynasty, and the Five Good Emperors {.import-Header3}

The year and a half after Nero's death saw more civil war and
instability throughout the empire than any other period since the late
Republic. In particular, the year 69 CE became known as the **Year**
**of the** **Four Emperors**, as four emperors in succession came to
power: Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian. Each challenged his
predecessor to a civil war, and each was as swiftly defeated by the next
challenger.

<figure id="attachment_396" class="wp-caption aligncenter"

</figure>

In the process, as the historian Tacitus later noted, the year of the
four emperors revealed two key secrets that continued to be a factor in
the subsequent history of the Empire. First, emperors could now be made
outside of Rome, as seen, for example, with Galba's proclamation as
emperor in Spain. Second, the army could make emperors; indeed, each of
the four emperors in 69 CE was proclaimed emperor by his troops. These
two *arcana* *imperii*, or "secrets of empire," as Tacitus dubbed them,
continued to play a strong role in the subsequent history of the Roman
Empire. Their unveiling showed the declining importance of Rome as the
center of political power and the concomitant decline in the importance
of the Senate.

Several reasons caused **Vespasian**, the son of a tax-collector, to be
the only successful emperor of 69 CE and the founder of the **Flavian**
**Dynasty**. First, a talented military commander, Vespasian proved to
be already in command of a major military force in 69 CE, since he had
been working on subduing the Jewish Revolt since 67 CE. Ironically, Nero
had originally appointed him to command the Jewish War because of
Vespasian's humble family origins---which to Nero meant that he was not
a political threat. Second, Vespasian was the only one of the four
emperors of 69 CE who had grown sons, and thus obvious successors.
Furthermore, his older son, Titus, was already a popular military
commander in his own right and cemented his reputation even further by
his conquest of Jerusalem in 70 CE.

The Flavian Dynasty did not last long, however, as it ended in 96 CE
with the assassination of Emperor Domitian, Vespasian's younger son. The
period from 96 CE to 180 CE saw a different experiment in determining
imperial succession. Known as the period of the "**Five Good
Emperors**," the trend in the second century CE was for each emperor to
adopt a talented leader with potential as his successor. The result was
what Edward Gibbon, the nineteenth-century British historian of Rome,
called "the happiest age" of mankind. But was life everywhere in the
Roman Empire in the second century equally happy for all? The evidence
suggests that while Rome and other major urban centers flourished, life
in the periphery could be a very different experience.

### 6.10.3 Center Versus Periphery in the Roman Empire: The Evidence of Pliny and Apuleius

Life in Rome was not representative of everyday life throughout the
empire. The problems with which residents of Rome had to contend were
very different from those of distant provinces. Careful examination of
two sources from the second century CE reveals that the relationship of
the Roman Empire to the provinces in the periphery was often uneasy.
Writing about two different provinces within a half-century of each
other, the two sources, Pliny the Younger and Apuleius, show the
complicated blessings of living in a Roman province far from the city of
Rome.

It is shocking to consider that most Roman governors received just one
type of personnel to assist them with their duties: a flute-player,
whose job was to play during sacrifice ceremonies. Since military forces
were expensive to maintain and needed for emergencies, most governors
did not have a legion stationed in their province. So how did governors
resolve problems, and what resources did they find when they arrived?
The single best source of information about Roman provincial government
is the prolific letter-writer Pliny the Younger, who served as governor
of the province of Bithynia on the shore of the Black Sea in 111--113
CE. Pliny was a cautious and conscientious governor and thus believed in
consulting the emperor **Trajan** on every single issue that he
encountered in his province. Luckily for us, their correspondence
survives.

Pliny's letters reveal a myriad of problems that the governor was
expected to solve: staffing personnel for prisons (is it acceptable to
use slaves as prison guards?); building repairs and water supply;
abandoned infants and their legal status (should they be considered
slave-born or free?); fire brigades (are they a potential security risk
to the Empire?); and, most famously, what to do with Christians in the
province. The emperor Trajan patiently responded to each letter that he
received from Pliny and appears to have placed stability and peace in
the province foremost in his concerns. For instance, with regard to the
issue of Christians, Trajan recommends that Pliny not worry about
tracking them down, as they were not a threat.

Another perspective from the periphery comes from the novel
*Metamorphoses* or *Golden Ass*, written by the North African
intellectual Apuleius sometime in the later part of the second century
CE. The protagonist of the novel, Lucius, is a curious intellectual who
is traveling through Greece and, through a magic experiment gone wrong,
accidentally is turned into a donkey. For the remainder of the novel,
Lucius, in his donkey form, is repeatedly stolen, traded, beaten, and
abused, until finally being rescued at the end of the novel by the
Egyptian goddess Isis, whose service he then enters as a priest.
Throughout his travels, though, Lucius' observations reveal the limits
of Romanization in the remote parts of Greece. Law and order are largely
absent, highway robbery is simply a normal part of life, and on the one
occasion when a poor farmer runs into a Roman soldier on the road, the
soldier forcibly requisitions the farmer's sole possession: his donkey.
Overall, the picture that Apuleius paints reveals the dark side of the
*Pax Romana*. Yes, the Empire was at peace, and few attacks were
happening on the frontiers. Yet life in the provinces was anything but
peaceful.

### 6.10.4 Early Christianity in the Context of the Roman Empire

One of the problems that arose in Bithynia during Pliny's time as
governor in 111--113 CE involved procedural questions on how to treat
Christians in the province. Pliny does not seem to have much knowledge
about them but is struck by what he describes as their stubbornness in
clinging to their faith even when threatened with death. As he points
out in his letter on the subject to Trajan, he has judged this
stubbornness alone sufficient to merit punishment, presumably because it
showed a dangerous level of disrespect towards Roman rule. Pliny's
perspective is one of the earliest non-Christian sources about the new
religion and shows how quickly it had spread over the Empire. But how
and why did the new religion spread so rapidly over the Empire, and why
was it so attractive to different populations? After all, cults and
self-proclaimed prophets periodically appeared in the Roman world, yet
none had the long-term impact of Christianity, which just two centuries
after Pliny's day became the religion of the Roman emperor himself.

Early Christianity is, in some ways, an ancient historian's dream: for
few other topics in Roman history do we have so many primary sources
from both the perspective of insiders and outsiders, beginning with the
earliest days of the movement. The **New Testament**, in particular, is
a collection of primary sources by early Christians about their
movement, with some of the letters composed merely twenty-five years
after Jesus' crucifixion. It is a remarkably open document, collecting
theological beliefs and stories about Jesus on which the faith was
built. At the same time, however, the New Testament does not
"white-wash" the early churches; rather, it documents their failings and
short-comings with remarkable frankness, allowing the historian to
consider the challenges that the early Christians faced from not only
the outside but also within the movement.

The story of the origins of the faith is explained more plainly in the
four Gospels, placed at the beginning of the New Testament. While
different emphases are present in each of the four Gospels, the basic
story is as follows: God himself came to earth as a human baby, lived a
life among the Jews, and performed a number of miracles that hinted at
his true identity but ultimately was crucified, died, and rose again on
the third day. His resurrection proved to contemporary witnesses that
his teachings were true and inspired many of those who originally
rejected him to follow him. While the movement originated as a movement
within Judaism, it quickly spread throughout the Greek-speaking
world---due to the work of such early missionaries as **Paul**.

It would be no exaggeration to call the early Christian movement
revolutionary. In a variety of respects, it challenged foundational
aspects of Roman and Greek society. First, the Christian view of God was
very different from the pagan conceptions of gods throughout the ancient
Mediterranean. While in traditional Roman paganism the gods had petty
concerns and could treat humans unfairly, Christianity by contrast
presented the message that God himself became man and dwelt with men as
an equal. This concept of God incarnate had revolutionary implications
for social relations in a Christian worldview. For early Christians,
their God's willingness to take on humanity and then sacrifice himself
for the sins of the world served as the greatest equalizer: since God
had suffered for all of them, they were all equally important to him,
and their social positions in the Roman world had no significance in
God's eyes. Finally, early Christianity was an apocalyptic religion.
Many early Christians believed that Jesus was coming back soon, and they
eagerly awaited his arrival.

</figure>

By contrast, traditional Roman society, as the Conflict of the Orders in
the early Republic showed, was extremely stratified. While the Conflict
of the Orders was resolved by the mid-Republic, sharp divisions between
the rich and poor remained. While social mobility was possible---for
instance, slaves could be freed, and within a generation, their
descendants could be Senators---extreme mobility was the exception
rather than the rule. Furthermore, gender roles in Roman society were
extremely rigid, as all women were subject to male authority. Indeed,
the ***paterfamilias***, or head of the household, had the power of life
or death over all living under his roof, including in some cases adult
sons, who had their own families. Christianity challenged these
traditional relationships, nullifying social differences and treating
the slave and the free the same way. Furthermore, Christianity provided
a greater degree of freedom than women had previously known in the
ancient world, with only the Stoics coming anywhere close in their view
on gender roles. Christianity allowed women to serve in the church and
remain unmarried, if they so chose, and even to become heroes of the
faith by virtue of their lives or deaths, as in the case of the early
martyrs. Indeed, the *Passion of the Saints Perpetua and Felicity*,
which documents the two women's martyrdom in Carthage in 203 CE, shows
all of these reversals of Roman tradition in practice.

*The* *Passion* *of* *the* *Saints* *Perpetua* *and* *Felicity* was
compiled by an editor shortly after the fact and includes Perpetua's own
prison diary as she awaited execution. The inclusion of a woman's
writings already makes the text unusual, as virtually all surviving
texts from the Roman world are by men. In addition, Perpetua was a
noblewoman, yet she was imprisoned and martyred together with her slave,
Felicity. The two women, as the text shows, saw each other as equals,
despite their obvious social distinction. Furthermore, Perpetua
challenged her father's authority as *paterfamilias* by refusing to obey
his command to renounce her faith and thus secure freedom. Such outright
disobedience would have been shocking to Roman audiences. Finally, both
Perpetua and Felicity placed their role as mothers beneath their
Christian identity, as both gave up their babies in order to be able to
be martyred. Their story, as those of other martyrs, was truly shocking
in their rebellion against Roman values, but their extraordinary faith
in the face of death proved to be contagious. As recent research shows,
conversion in the Roman Empire sped up over the course of the second and
third centuries CE, despite periodic persecutions by such emperors as
Septimius Severus, who issued an edict in 203 CE forbidding any
conversions to Judaism and Christianity. That edict led to the execution
of Perpetua and Felicity.

Most of the early Christians lived less eventful (and less painful)
lives than Perpetua and Felicity, but the reversals to tradition
inherent in Christianity appear clearly in their lives as well. First,
the evidence of the New Testament, portions of which were written as
early as the 60s CE, shows that the earliest Christians were from all
walks of life. Paul, for instance, was a tent-maker. Some other
professions of Christians and new converts that are mentioned in the New
Testament include prison guards, Roman military officials of varying
ranks, and merchants. Some, like Paul, were Roman citizens, with all the
perks inherent in that position, including the right of appeal to the
emperor and the right to be tried in Rome. Others were non-citizen free
males of varying provinces, women, and slaves. Stories preserved in
*Acts* and in the epistles of Paul that are part of the New Testament
reveal ways---the good, the bad, and the ugly---in which these very
different people tried to come together and treat each other as brothers
and sisters in Christ. Some of the struggles that these early churches
faced included sexual scandal (the Corinthian church witnessed the
affair of a stepmother with her stepson); quarrelling and litigation
between members; and the challenge of figuring out the appropriate
relationship between the requirements of Judaism and Christianity
(circumcision and strict Jewish dietary laws). It is important to note
that early Christianity appears to have been predominantly an urban
religion and spread most quickly throughout urban centers. Thus, Paul's
letters address the churches in different cities throughout the
Greek-speaking world and show the existence of a network of
relationships between the early churches, despite the physical distance
between them. Through that network, the churches were able to carry out
group projects, such as fundraising for areas in distress, and could
also assist Christian missionaries in their work. By the early second
century CE, urban churches were led by bishops, who functioned as
overseers for spiritual and practical matters of the church in their
region.

## 6.11 THE THIRD-CENTURY CRISIS AND LATE ANTIQUITY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

While the second century CE was a time when the Empire flourished, the
third century was a time of crisis. It was defined by political
instability and civil wars, which ultimately demonstrated that the
Empire had become too large to be effectively controlled by one ruler.
Furthermore, the increasing pressures on the frontiers, which required
emperors to spend much of their time on campaigns, resulted in the
decline of the importance of the city of Rome. By the end of the third
century, an experiment with dividing the empire showed a different model
of rule, one which lasted, albeit with some interludes, until the last
Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in 476 CE. While the
political narrative of the third century and Late Antiquity could be
described as a story of decline and fall of the Roman Empire (as the
British historian Gibbon famously called it), it was also a period in
which culture, especially Christian culture, flourished and replaced the
traditional Roman pagan mode of thinking. Far from being culturally a
time of "decline and fall," Late Antiquity, rather, was looking forward
to the world of the Middle Ages. It was also the period of Roman history
that produced some of its most influential leaders, most notably,
Constantine.

### 6.11.1 The Third-Century Crisis and Diocletian

Although composed during a time of prosperity in the Empire, Apuleius'
novel *Metamorphoses* showed tensions in the provinces, indicative of
the failure of the Empire to govern all portions equally effectively.
These tensions manifested themselves clearly during the
**third-century** **crisis**, a period of almost fifty years (235--284
CE) that was characterized by unprecedented political, social, and
economic upheaval across the Empire. In effect, the third-century crisis
was the year 69 CE repeated, but this time, it stretched over half a
century. The same secrets of power that 69 CE revealed for the first
time--- that armies could make emperors and that emperors could be made
outside of Rome---were now on display yet again.

In 235 CE, the emperor Severus Alexander was assassinated by his troops
on campaign, who then proclaimed as emperor their general Maximinus
Thrax. Over the subsequent half-century, twenty-six emperors were
officially recognized by the Roman Senate, and a number of others were
proclaimed emperors but did not live long enough to consolidate power
and be officially accepted as emperors by the Senate. Most of these new
emperors were military generals who were proclaimed by their troops on
campaign. Most did not have any previous political experience and thus
had no clear program for ruling the empire. The competing claims
resulted in the temporary breaking away from the Roman Empire of regions
to the East and the Northwest.

The political instability that resulted was not, however, the only
problem with which the Empire had to contend. In addition to political
upheaval and near-constant civil wars, the Empire was also dealing with
increasing pressures on the frontiers, a plague that devastated the
population, a famine, and rampant inflation. Roman emperors, starting
with Nero, had been debasing the Roman coinage, but not until the
third-century crisis did inflation hit in full force.

The third-century crisis showed that a single emperor stationed in Rome
was no longer equipped to deal with the challenges of ruling such a vast
territory. And, indeed, so recognized the man who ended the crisis: the
emperor **Diocletian**. Born to a socially insignificant family in the
province of Dalmatia, Diocletian had a successful military career.
Proclaimed emperor by his troops in 284 CE, Diocletian promptly
displayed a political acumen that none of his predecessors in the third
century possessed. Diocletian realized that a single emperor in charge
of the entire empire was a "sitting duck," whose assassination would
throw the entire empire into yet another civil war. He thus established
a new system of rule known as the **Tetrarchy**, or the rule of four.
This system divided the empire into four regions, each with its own
capital.

It is important to note that Rome was not the capital of its region.
Diocletian clearly wanted to select as capitals cities with strategic
importance, often near problematic frontiers. Of course, as a Dalmatian
of low birth, Diocletian also lacked the emotional connection to Rome
that the earliest emperors possessed. Two of the regions of the
Tetrarchy were ruled by senior emperors, named Augusti ("Augustus" in
the singular), and two were ruled by junior emperors, named Caesares
("Caesar" in the singular). One of the Augusti was Diocletian himself,
with Maximian as the second Augustus. The two men's sons-in-law,
Galerius and Constantus Chlorus, became the two Caesares. Diocletian
also attempted to address other major problems, such as inflation, by
passing the Edict of Maximum Prices. This edict set a maximum price that
could be charged on basic goods and services in the Empire. He also
significantly increased the imperial bureaucracy. In a nutshell, as some
modern historians have described him, Diocletian was the most
significant Roman reformer since Augustus.

Diocletian's political experiment was most clearly successful in
achieving one goal: ending the third-century crisis. The four men were
able to rule the empire and restore a degree of political stability. A
statue column of the Tetrarchs together displays their message of unity
in rule: the four men are portrayed identically, so it is impossible to
tell them apart. Showing their predominantly military roles, they are
dressed in military garb, rather than the toga, the garb of politicians
and citizens, and each holds one hand on the hilt of his sword and hugs
one of the other Tetrarchs with the other.

While it succeeded in restoring stability to the Empire, inherent within
the Tetrarchy was the question of succession, which turned out to be a
much greater problem than Diocletian had anticipated. Hoping to provide
for a smooth transition of power, Diocletian abdicated in 305 CE and
required Maximian to do the same. The two Caesares, junior emperors,
were promptly promoted to Augusti, and two new Caesares were appointed.
The following year, however, Constantius Chlorus, a newly minted
Augustus, died. His death resulted in a series of wars for succession,
which ended the Tetrarchy. The wars ended with Constantius' son,
**Constantine**, reuniting the entire Roman Empire under his rule in 324
CE. In the process, Constantine also brought about a major religious
shift in the Empire.

### 6.11.2 From Constantine to the Last Pagans of Rome

While traditional Roman religion was the ultimate melting pot,
organically incorporating a broad variety of new cults and movements
from the earliest periods of Roman expansion, Christianity's
monotheistic exclusivity challenged traditional Roman religion and
transformed Roman ways of thinking about religion. By the early fourth
century CE, historians estimate that about ten percent of those living
in the Roman Empire were Christians. With Constantine's endorsement,
however, this changed. The emperor's conversion must have seemed nothing
short of miraculous to contemporaries, and a miracle is told to explain
it in contemporary sources. Before a major battle in 312 CE, Constantine
reportedly had a dream or a vision in which Christ himself told
Constantine to place the Greek letters X and P (Chi, Rho, the first two
letters of Christ's name in the Greek alphabet) on his soldiers' shields
to assure victory.

</figure>

Grateful for his subsequent victory, Constantine proceeded to play a
major role in the government of the church over the course of his rule,
although he was not baptized himself until he was on his deathbed.
Constantine, for instance, summoned the First **Council of Nicaea** in
325 CE, which gathered major bishops from all over the Empire. The
Council settled, among other issues, the question of the relationship of
God the Father and God the Son, declaring them to have been one being
from the creation of the world, thus affirming the doctrine of the
Trinity. The Council set a significant precedent for the communication
of bishops in the Empire. It ended up being merely the first of seven
major ecumenical councils, the last of them being the Second Council of
Nicaea in 787 CE. The councils allowed the increasingly different
churches of the Eastern and Western parts of the Roman Empire to work
together on key doctrines and beliefs of the church.

Last but not least, Constantine's rule marked the end of the city of
Rome as the capital of the Roman Empire. Upon reuniting the Empire in
324 CE, Constantine established his capital at the old location of the
Greek city of Byzantium, but he renamed it **Constantinople**. The
location had strategic advantages for the Empire at that stage. First,
it had an excellent harbor. Second, it was close to the Persian
frontier, as well as the Danube frontier, a trouble area that required
attention from the emperor. Finally, building this new city allowed
Constantine to send the message that his rule was a new beginning for
the Roman Empire, which was now to be a Christian empire.

With the emperor's backing, Christianity seems to have grown
exponentially over the course of the fourth century CE, much to the
chagrin of **Julian the Apostate**, Rome's final pagan emperor, who
tried hard to restore traditional Roman paganism during his brief rule
(361--363 CE). Finally, the emperor **Theodosius** gradually banned
paganism altogether by 395 CE. Thus a mere eighty-three years after
Constantine's initial expression of support, Christianity became the
official religion of Rome. Paganism continued to limp along for another
century or so, but without state support, it slowly died out.

### 6.11.3 The Decline of the Empire---Looking Forward while Looking Back with Augustine and the Last Pagans of Rome

Imagine that you are a citizen of the greatest empire on earth. In fact,
you reside in the greatest city of the greatest empire on earth. You
feel protected by the pact that was made between the founders of your
state and the traditional gods. The *pax* *deorum*, or peace with the
gods, struck a clear bargain: as long as you and your state worshipped
the gods and maintained peace with them, they would make it prosper. And
prosper it did! Starting out as a tiny village on the marshes of the
Tiber, the Roman Empire at its height encircled the entire
Mediterranean, extending to Britain and the Rhine and Danube frontiers
to the north and including a wide strip of North Africa in its southern
half.

But something went so terribly wrong along the way, testing the gods'
patience with Rome. A new sect started out in Judaea in the first
century CE, one which followed a crucified Messiah. Spreading outward
like a wildfire to all parts of the empire, this sect challenged and
gradually replaced the worship of the traditional gods, bringing even
the emperors into its fold, starting with Constantine in the early
fourth century CE. This outright violation of the thousand-year-old pact
between the Romans and their gods could have only one outcome:
punishment from the gods. And so it did; in 410 CE, the unthinkable
happened. The city of Rome, untouched by foreign foes since the early
days of the Republic, was sacked by the Goths, a Germanic tribe. How
could something so terrible happen? And how could the Roman Empire
recover from it?

Such was the thought process of the typical Roman pagan, and especially
the pagan aristocrat, as few of those as were left by 410 CE. And it was
in response to these questions that Augustine, veteran theologian,
philosopher, and bishop of Hippo in North Africa, wrote the final
*magnum* *opus* of his career, the monumental twenty-two-book effort
that he appropriately titled *De* *Civitate* *Dei* *Contra* *Paganos*,
or *On the* ***City of God*** *against* *the* *Pagans*. Born in North
Africa in 354 CE, Augustine was educated in Rome and Milan, and after a
wild youth---about which he tells us in his *Confessions*--- he rose to
the post of the Bishop of Hippo in 396 CE. A famous figure by 410 CE, he
was ideally suited to address the tragedy of the sack of Rome and the
concerns that this event inspired in Christians and pagans alike.

</figure>

In his book, Augustine presented an argument that challenged the core of
Roman traditional beliefs about the state. Challenging the fundamental
Roman pagan belief that Roman success was the result of the *pax*
*deorum*, Augustine effectively argued that there was nothing special
about Rome. It only prospered in its earlier history because God allowed
it to do so. Furthermore, argued Augustine, obsession with Rome,
emblematic of obsession with the earthly kingdom and way of life, was
the wrong place for turning one's attention. The City of God was the
only place that mattered, and the City of God was most definitely not
Rome. By turning away from this world and focusing on the next, one
could find true happiness and identity as a citizen of God's kingdom,
which is the only city that is everlasting and free from threat of
invasion or destruction.

## 6.12 CONCLUSION: FROM LATE ANTIQUITY TO THE MIDDLE AGES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

After the death of the emperor Theodosius in 395 CE, the Roman Empire
became permanently divided into Eastern and Western Empires, with
instability and pressures on the frontiers continuing, especially in the
West.

The sack of Rome by the Goths in 410 CE, which so shocked Augustine's
contemporaries, was followed by an equally destructive sack of Carthage
by the Vandals in 439 CE, as well as continuing raids of Roman
territories by the Huns, a nomadic tribe from the East. The Huns
experienced an especially prolific period of conquest in the 440s and
early 450s CE under the leadership of Attila. While they were not able
to hold on to their conquests after Attila's death in 453 CE, their
attacks further destabilized an already weakened Western Roman Empire.
Finally, the deposition of the emperor Romulus Augustulus in 476 CE
marked the end of the Roman Empire in the West. The Eastern half of the
Empire continued to flourish for another thousand years.

The fall of the Roman Empire in the West, however, was not as clear and
dramatic as it might seem. A number of tribes carved out territories,
each for its own control. Over the next five hundred years, led by
ambitious tribal chiefs, these territories coalesced into actual
kingdoms. Rome was gone, yet its specter loomed large over these tribes
and their leaders, who spoke forms of Latin, believed in the Christian
faith, and dreamed of the title of Roman Emperor.

## 7.2 INTRODUCTION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

It was Christmas Day in Rome in the year 800 CE. The cavernous interior
of St. Peter's Church smelled faintly of incense. Marble columns lined
the open space of the nave, which was packed with the people of Rome. At
the eastern end of the church, which was the most prestigious in Western
Europe, King Charles of the Franks knelt before the pope. A tall man
when standing, the Frankish king had an imposing presence even on his
knees. He wore the dress of a Roman patrician: a tunic of multi-colored
silk, embroidered trousers, and a richly embroidered cloak clasped with
a golden brooch at his shoulder. As King Charles knelt, the pope placed
a golden crown, set with pearls and precious stones of blue, green, and
red, on the king's head. He stood to his full height of six feet and the
people gathered in the church cried out, "Hail Charles, Emperor of
Rome!" The inside of the church filled with cheers. For the first time
in three centuries, the city of Rome had an emperor. Outside of the
church, the city of Rome itself told a different story. The great
circuit of walls built in the third century by the emperor Aurelian
still stood as a mighty bulwark against attackers. Much of the land
within those walls, however, lay empty. Although churches of all sorts
could be found throughout the city, pigs, goats, and other livestock
roamed through the open fields and streets of a city retaining only the
faintest echo of its earlier dominance of the whole of the Mediterranean
world. Where once the Roman forum had been a bustling market, filled
with merchants from as far away as India, now the crumbling columns of
long-abandoned temples looked out over a broad, grassy field where
shepherds grazed their flocks.

The fountains that had once given drinking water to millions of
inhabitants now went unused and choked with weeds. The once great baths
that had echoed with the lively conversation of thousands of bathers
stood only as tumbled-down piles of stone that served as quarries for
the men and women who looked to repair their modest homes. The Coliseum,
the great amphitheater that had rung with the cries of Rome's
bloodthirsty mobs, was now honeycombed with houses built into the
tunnels that had once admitted crowds to the games in the arena.

And yet within this city of ruins, a new Rome sprouted from the ruins of
the old. Just outside the city walls and across the Tiber River, St.
Peter's Basilica rose as the symbol of Peter, prince of the Apostles.
The golden-domed Pantheon still stood, now a church of the Triune God
rather than a temple of the gods of the old world. And, indeed, all
across Western Europe, a new order had arisen on the wreck of the Roman
state. Although this new order in many ways shared the universal ideals
of Rome, its claims were even grander, for it rested upon the
foundations of the Christian faith, which claimed the allegiance of all
people. How this post-Roman world had come about is the subject to which
we shall turn.

Ever since the fifteenth century, historians of Europe have referred to
the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Italian
Renaissance (which took place in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries)
as the Middle Ages. The term has problems, but it is still useful
because it demonstrates that Europe was undergoing a transitional
period: it stood between, in the middle of, those times that we call
"modern" (after 1500 CE) and what we call the ancient world (up to
around 500 CE). This Middle Age would see a new culture grow up that
combined elements of Germanic culture, Christianity, and remnants of
Rome. It is to the political remnants of Rome that we first turn.

## 7.5 SUCCESSOR KINGDOMS TO THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The Germanic peoples who had invaded the Roman Empire over the course of
the fifth century had, by the early 500s, established a set of kingdoms
in what had been the Western Empire. The **Vandals** ruled North Africa
in a kingdom centered on Carthage, a kingdom whose pirates threatened
the Mediterranean for nearly eighty years. The **Visigoths** ruled Spain
in a kingdom that preserved many elements of Roman culture. In Italy,
the Roman general Odavacar had established his own kingdom in 476 before
being murdered by the **Ostrogoth** king Theodoric, who established a
kingdom for his people in Italy, which he ruled from 493 to his death in
526. Vandal, Visigoth, and Ostrogoth peoples all had cultures that had
been heavily influenced over decades or even centuries of contact with
Rome. Most of them were Christians, but, crucially, they were not
Catholic Christians, who believed in the doctrine of the Trinity, that
God is one God but three distinct persons of the Father, the Son (Jesus
Christ), and the Holy Spirit. They were rather Arians, who believed that
Jesus was lesser than God the Father (see Chapter Six). Most of their
subjects, however, were Catholics.

The Catholic Church increasingly looked to the bishop of Rome for
leadership. Over the fifth century, the bishop of Rome had gradually
come to take on an increasing level of prestige among other bishops.
Rome had been the city where Peter, whom tradition regarded as the chief
of Christ's disciples, had ended his life as a martyr. Moreover, even
though the power of the Western Roman Empire crumbled over the course of
the 400s, the city of Rome itself remained prestigious. As such, by the
fourth and fifth centuries, the bishops of Rome were often given the
title of *papa*, Latin for "father," a term that we translate into
**pope**. Gradually, the popes came to be seen as having a role of
leadership within the wider Church, although they did not have the
monarchial authority that later popes would claim.

In the region of Gaul, the Franks were a Germanic people who had fought
as mercenaries in the later Roman Empire and then, with the
disintegration of the Western Empire, had established their own kingdom.
One key reason for the Frankish kingdom's success was that its kings
received their legitimacy from the Church. In the same way that the
Christian Church had endorsed the Roman emperors since Constantine and,
in return, these emperors supported the Church, the Frankish kings took
up a similar relation with the Christian religion. King Clovis (r.
481--509) united the Franks into a kingdom and, in 496, converted to
Christianity. More importantly, he converted to the Catholic
Christianity of his subjects in post-Roman Gaul. This would put the
Franks in sharp contrast with the Vandals, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths,
all of whom were Arians.

In none of these kingdoms, Visigothic, Ostrogothic, Frankish, or Vandal,
did the Germanic peoples who ruled them seek to destroy Roman
society---far from it. Rather, they sought homelands and to live as the
elites of the Roman Empire had done before them. Theodoric, the king of
the Ostrogoths (r. 493--526), had told his people to "obey Roman
customs... \[and\] clothe \[them\] selves in the morals of the
toga."[^\[1\]^](#chapter-007-unknown-5.xhtml_footnote-426-1 "Cassiodorus, Variae, trans. Thomas Hodgkin, in The Medieval Record: Sources of History, ed. Alfred J. Andrea (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1997), 58"){#chapter-007-unknown-5.xhtml_return-footnote-426-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"} Indeed, in the generations after the
end of the Western Empire in the late 400s, an urban, literate culture
continued to flourish in Spain, Italy, and parts of Gaul. The Germanic
peoples often took up a place as elites in the society of what had been
Roman provinces, living in rural villas with large estates. Local elites
shifted their allegiances from the vanished Roman Empire to their new
rulers. In many ways, the situation of Western Europe was analogous to
that of the successor states of the Han Dynasty such as Northern Wei, in
which an invader took up a position as the society's new warrior
aristocracy (see Chapter Four).

But even though the Germanic kings of Western Europe had sought to
simply rule in the place of (or along with) their Roman predecessors,
many of the features that had characterized Western Europe under the
Romans---populous cities; a large, literate population; a complex
infrastructure of roads and aqueducts; and the complex bureaucracy of a
centralized state---vanished over the course of the sixth century.
Cities shrank drastically, and in those regions of Gaul north of the
Loire River, they nearly all vanished in a process that we call
**ruralization**. As Europe ruralized and elite values came to reflect
warfare rather than literature, schools gradually vanished, leaving the
Church as the only real institution providing education. So too did the
tax-collecting apparatus of the Roman state gradually wither in the
Germanic kingdoms. The Europe of 500 may have looked a lot like the
Europe of 400, but the Europe of 600 was one that was poorer, more
rural, and less literate.

## 7.6 BYZANTIUM: THE AGE OF JUSTINIAN {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

An observer of early sixth-century Italy would have thought that its
Ostrogothic kingdom was the best poised to carry forward with a new
state that, in spite of its smaller size than the Roman Empire,
nevertheless had most of the same features. But the Ostrogothic kingdom
would only last a few decades before meeting its violent end. That end
came at the hands of the Eastern Roman Empire, the half of the Roman
Empire that had continued after the end of the Empire in the West. We
usually refer to that empire as the **Byzantine Empire** or
**Byzantium**.

The inhabitants and rulers of this Empire did not call themselves
Byzantines but rather referred to themselves as Romans. Their empire,
after all, was a continuation of the Roman state. Modern historians call
it the Byzantine Empire in order to distinguish it from the Roman Empire
that dominated the Mediterranean world from the first through fifth
centuries. The Byzantine Empire or Byzantium is called such by
historians because Byzantium had been an earlier name for its capital,
**Constantinople.**

By the beginning of the sixth century, the Byzantine army was the most
lethal army to be found outside of China. In the late fifth century, the
Byzantine emperors had built up an army capable of dealing with the
threat of both Hunnic invaders and the Sassanids, a dynasty of
aggressively expansionist kings who had seized control of Persia in the
third century. Soon this army would turn against the Ostrogothic kingdom
of Italy.

The man who would destroy the Ostrogothic as well as the Vandal kingdom
was the emperor Justinian (r. 527--565). Justinian had
[come]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}not from the
ranks of the aristocracy of the Eastern Roman Empire but rather from the
army. Even before the death of his uncle, the emperor Justin I (r.
518--527), Justinian was taking part in the rule of the Empire. Upon his
accession to the imperial throne, he carried out a set of policies
designed to emphasize his own greatness and that of his empire. He did
so in the domain of art and architecture, sponsoring the construction of
numerous buildings both sacred and secular. The centerpiece of his
building campaign was the church called **Hagia** **Sophia**, Greek for
"Divine Wisdom." His architects placed this church in the central
position of the city of Constantinople, adjacent to the imperial palace.
This placement was meant to demonstrate the close relationship between
the Byzantine state and the Church that legitimated that state. The
Hagia Sophia would be the principal church of the Eastern Empire for the
next thousand years, and it would go on to inspire countless imitations.

This Church was the largest building in Europe. Its domed roof was one
hundred and sixty feet in height, and supported by four arches one
hundred and twenty feet high, it seemed to float in the diffuse light
that came in through its windows. The interior of the church was
burnished with gold, gems, and marble, so that observers in the church
were said to have claimed that they could not tell if they were on earth
or in heaven. Even a work as magnificent as the Hagia Sophia, though,
showed a changed world: it was produced with mortar rather than
concrete, the technology for the making of which had already been
forgotten.

While Justinian's building showed his authority and right to rule which
came from his close relations with the Church, his efforts as a lawmaker
showed the secular side of his authority. Under his direction, the
jurist Tribonian took the previous 900 years' worth of Roman Law and
systematized it into a text known as the ***Body of Civil Law*** or the
**Justinian Code**. This law code, based on the already-sophisticated
system of Roman Law, would go on to serve as the foundation of European
law and thus of much of the world's law as well.

Although the Justinian Code was based on the previous nine centuries of
gathered law, Roman Law itself had changed over the course of the fifth
century with the Christianization of the Empire. By the time of
Justinian's law code, Jews had lost civil rights to the extent that the
law forbade them from testifying in court against Christians. Jews would
further lose civil rights in those Germanic kingdoms whose law was
influenced by Roman Law as well. The reason for this lack of Jewish
civil rights was that many Christians blamed Jews for the execution of
Jesus and believed that Jews refused out of stubbornness to believe that
Jesus had been the Messiah. A Christian Empire was thus one that was
often extremely unfriendly to Jews.

As Byzantine emperor (and thus Roman emperor), Justinian would have
regarded his rule as universal, so he sought to re-establish the
authority of the Empire in Western Europe. The emperor had other reasons
as well for seeking to re-establish imperial power in the West. Both
Vandal Carthage and Ostrogoth Italy were ruled by peoples who were
Arians, regarded as heretics by a Catholic emperor like Justinian.

During a dispute over the throne in the Vandal kingdom, the reigning
monarch was overthrown and fled to the Eastern Empire for help and
protection. This event gave Justinian his chance. In 533, he sent his
commander Belisarius to the west, and in less than a year, this able and
capable general had defeated the Vandals, destroyed their kingdom, and
brought North Africa back into the Roman Empire. Justinian then turned
his sights on a greater prize: Italy, home of the city of Rome itself,
which, although no longer under the Empire's sway, still held a place of
honor and prestige.

In 535, the Roman general Belisarius crossed into Italy to return it to
the Roman Empire. Unfortunately for the peninsula's inhabitants, the
Ostrogothic kingdom put up a more robust fight than had the Vandals in
North Africa. It took the Byzantine army nearly two decades to destroy
the Ostrogothic kingdom and return Italy to the rule of the Roman
Empire. In that time, however, Italy itself was irrevocably damaged. The
city of Rome had suffered through numerous sieges and sacks. By the time
it was fully in the hands of Justinian's troops, the fountains that had
provided drinking water for a city of millions were choked with rubble,
the aqueducts that had supplied them smashed. The great architecture of
the city lay in ruins, and the population had shrunk drastically from
what it had been even in the days of Theodoric (r. 493--526).

Justinian's reconquest of Italy would prove to be short-lived. Less than
a decade after restoring Italy to Roman rule, the **Lombards**, another
Germanic people, invaded Italy. Although the city of Rome itself and the
southern part of the peninsula remained under the rule of the Byzantine
Empire, much of northern and central Italy was
ruled[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[by]{style="font-size: 1em;"} either
Lombard kings or other petty nobles.

But war was only one catastrophe to trouble Western Europe. For reasons
that are poorly understood even today, the long-range trade networks
across the Mediterranean Sea gradually shrank over the sixth and seventh
centuries. Instead of traveling across the Mediterranean, wine, grain,
and pottery were increasingly sold in local markets. Only luxury
goods---always a tiny minority of most trade---remained traded over long
distances.

Nor was even the heartland of Justinian's empire safe from external
threat. The emperor Heraclius (r. 610--641) came to power in the midst
of an invasion of the Empire by the Sassanid Persians, who, under their
king Khusrau (see Chapter Eight), threatened the Empire's very
existence, his armies coming within striking range of Constantinople
itself. Moreover, Persian armies had seized control of Egypt and the
Levant, which they would hold for over a decade. Heraclius thwarted the
invasion only by launching a counterattack into the heart of the Persian
Empire that resulted, in the end, in a Byzantine victory. No sooner had
the Empire repelled one threat than another appeared that would threaten
the Empire with consequences far more severe. Under the influence of the
Prophet Muhammad, the tribes of the Arabian deserts had been united
under first the guidance of the Prophet and then his successors, the
caliphs and the religion founded by Muhammad, Islam (see Chapter Eight).
Under the vigorous leadership of the first caliphs, Arab Muslim armies
invaded both Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire. At the Battle of
Yarmouk in 636, although the Byzantines and Arabs were evenly matched,
the Byzantine field army was badly beaten. In the aftermath, first Syria
and Palestine and then Egypt fell from Christian Byzantine rule to the
cultural and political influence of Islam.

The seventh century also saw invasions by various semi-nomadic peoples
into the **Balkans**, the region between the Greek Peloponnese and the
Danube River. Among these peoples were the Turkic **Bulgars**, the
**Avars** (who historians think might have been Turkic), and various
peoples known as **Slavs**. The Avars remained nomads on the plains of
Central Europe, but both Bulgars and Slavs settled in Balkan territories
that no longer fell under the rule of the Byzantine state. Within a
generation, the Empire had lost control of the Balkans as well as Egypt,
territory comprising an immense source of wealth in both agriculture and
trade. By the end of the seventh century, the Empire was a shadow of its
former self.

Indeed, the Byzantine Empire faced many of the social and cultural
challenges that Western Europe did, although continuity with the Roman
state remained. In many cases, the cities of the Byzantine Empire shrank
nearly as drastically as did the cities of Western Europe. Under the
threat of invasion, many communities moved to smaller settlements on
more easily defended hilltops. The great metropolises of Constantinople
and Thessalonica remained centers of urban life and activity, but
throughout much of the Empire, life became overwhelmingly rural.

Even more basic elements of a complex society, such as literacy and a
cash economy, went into decline, although they did not cease. The
Byzantine state issued less money, and indeed, most transactions ceased
to be in cash at this time. The economy was **demonetized**. Even
literacy rates shrank. Although churchmen and other elites would often
still have an education, the days of the Roman state in which a large
literate reading public would buy readily-available literature were
gone. As in the west, literacy increasingly became the preserve of the
religious.

## 7.7 PERSPECTIVES: POST-ROMAN EAST AND WEST {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In many ways, the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms of Western Europe and the
Byzantine Empire shared a similar fate. Both saw a sharp
ruralization---that is, a decline in the number of inhabited cities and
the size of those cities that were inhabited. Both saw plunges in
literacy. And both saw a state that was less competent---even at tax
collection. Moreover, the entire Mediterranean Sea and its environs
showed a steady decline in high-volume trade, a decline that lasted for
nearly two and a half centuries. By around the year 700, almost all
trade was local.

But there remained profound differences between Byzantium and the
Germanic kingdoms of Western Europe. In the first place, although its
reach had shrunk dramatically from the days of Augustus, the imperial
state remained. Although the state collected less in taxes and issued
less money than in earlier years, even in the period of the empire's
greatest crisis, it continued to mint some coins, and the apparatus of
the state continued to function. In Western Europe, by contrast, the
Germanic kingdoms gradually lost the ability to collect taxes (except
for the Visigoths in Spain). Likewise, they gradually ceased to mint
gold coins. In Britain, cities had all but vanished. The island was
inhabited by peoples living in small villages, the remnants of Rome's
imperial might standing as silent ruins.

The post-Roman world stands in contrast to post-Han China. Although the
imperial state collapsed in China, literacy never declined as
drastically as in the Roman Empire. The apparatus of tax collection and
other features of a functional state also remained in the Han successor
states to an extent that they did not in either Rome or Byzantium.

## 7.8 THE BRITISH ISLES: EUROPE'S PERIPHERY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In many of the lands that had been part of the Roman Empire, the
Germanic peoples who had taken over Western Europe built kingdoms.
Although not as sophisticated as the Roman state, they were still
recognizable as states. This situation stood in sharp contrast to
Britain. To the northwest of Europe, the Roman Army had abandoned the
island of Britain in 410. The urban infrastructure brought about by the
Roman state began to decay almost immediately, with towns gradually
emptying out as people returned to rural lifeways that had existed prior
to Rome's arrival.

<figure id="attachment_414" class="wp-caption aligncenter"

</figure>

At nearly the same time that the Roman Army withdrew from Britain, a
group of Germanic peoples known as the **Anglo-Saxons** were moving into
the island from the forests of Central Europe that lay to the east,
across the sea. Unlike the Franks, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths, each of
whom had kingdoms, the social organization of the Anglo-Saxons was
comparatively unsophisticated. They were divided among chiefs and kings
who had a few hundred to a few thousand subjects each.

Between about 410 and 600, the Anglo-Saxons gradually settled in and
conquered much of southeastern Britain, replacing the Celtic-speaking
peoples and their language. The island of Britain was completely rural.
All that remained of the state-building of the Romans was the ruins of
abandoned cities.

And yet, it would be England (called England because the name is derived
from the word Anglo-Saxon) and the island of Ireland to its west that
would lead to an increase of schools and literacy across Western Europe.
In the fifth century, Christian missionaries traveled to Ireland and
converted many of its peoples. In the early 600s, Pope Gregory the Great
sent missionaries to the island of Britain. The English peoples adopted
Christianity (usually under the initiative of their kings) over the
course of the next several decades, which in turn led to the founding of
monasteries. These monasteries would usually have attached schools so
that those seeking to live as monks could have access to the texts of
the Bible, the **liturgy**, and the writings of other churchmen. English
churchmen like Benedict Biscop (c. 628--690) traveled south to Rome and
returned to England with cartloads of books. English and Irish monks
would often copy these books in their own monasteries.

Indeed, England saw not only the copying of older books but also the
composition of original literature, which was rare elsewhere in Western
Europe of this time. The English churchman Bede (672--735) composed a
history of England's people. He wrote this history to show how the
Anglo-Saxons had adopted Christianity. Within a few decades of the
island's peoples converting to Christianity, English and Irish monks
were traveling to Western Europe, either to establish monasteries in
lands already Christian or to serve as missionaries to those still-pagan
peoples in the forests of Central Europe.

## 7.9 BYZANTIUM: CRISIS AND RECOVERY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Although the Byzantine Empire was a remnant of the Roman state, by the
eighth century, it was much weaker than the Roman Empire under Augustus
or even than the Eastern Empire under Justinian. After their conquest of
Egypt, the forces of the caliphate had built a navy and used it to sail
up and lay siege to Constantinople itself in two sieges lasting from 674
to 678 and from 717 to 718. On land, to the northwest, the Empire faced
the threat of the Bulgars, Slavs, and Avars. The Avars, a nomadic
people, demanded that the Byzantine state pay them a hefty tribute to
avoid raids. At the very moment that the Empire was in greatest need of
military strength, it was poorer than it had ever been.

The solution was a reorganization of the military. Instead of having a
military that was paid out of a central treasury, the emperors divided
the Empire up into regions called **themes**. Each theme would then
equip and pay soldiers, using its agricultural resources to do so.
Themes in coastal regions were responsible for the navy. In many ways,
this was similar to the way that other states would raise soldiers in
the absence of a strong bureaucratic apparatus. One might liken it to
what we call feudalism in Zhou China, Heian Japan, and later Medieval
Europe.

The greatest crisis faced by the Byzantine Empire in these years of
crisis was the so-called **Iconoclast Controversy**. From the fourth and
fifth centuries, Christians living in the Eastern Mediterranean region
had used icons to aid in worship. An **icon** is a highly stylized
painting of Christ, the Virgin Mary (his mother), or the saints. Often
icons appeared in churches, with the ceiling painted with a picture of
Christ or with an emblem of Christ above the entrance of a church.

Other Christians opposed this use of images. In the Old Testament (the
term Christians use to refer to the Hebrew Bible), the Ten Commandments
forbid the making of "graven images" and using them in worship (Exodus
20:4--5). Certain Christians at the time believed that to make an image
even of Jesus Christ and his mother violated that commandment, arguing
that to paint such pictures and use them in worship was
**idolatry**---that is, worshiping something other than God. Muslims
leveled similar critiques at the Christian use of icons, claiming that
Christians had fallen from the correct worship of God into idolatry.

Emperor Leo III (r. 717--41) accepted these arguments; consequently, in
his reign, he began to order icons removed (or painted over) first from
churches and then from monasteries as well as other places of public
display. His successors took further action, ordering the destruction of
icons. These acts by Leo led to nearly a century of controversy over
whether the use of icons in worship was permissible to Christians. The
**iconophiles** argued that to use a picture of Christ and the saints in
worship was in line with the Christian scriptures so long as the
worshiper worshiped God with the icon as a guide, while the
**iconoclasts** proclaimed that any use of images in Christian worship
was forbidden.

In general, monks and civilian elites were iconophiles, while iconoclasm
was popular with the army. In Rome, which was slipping out from under
the jurisdiction of the Byzantine emperors, the popes strongly rejected
iconoclasm. Some historians have argued that Leo and his successors
attacked icon worship for reasons other than religious convictions
alone, including the fact that monks who venerated icons had built up
their own power base; more importantly, in confiscating the wealth of
iconophile monasteries, the emperor would be able to better fund his
armed forces.

The iconophile empress Irene, ruling on behalf of her infant son
Constantine V (r. 780--797), convoked a new church council to bring an
end to the controversy. At the 787 Second Council of Nicaea, the Church
decreed that icons could be used in worship. Final resolution of the
Iconoclast Controversy, however, would have to wait until 843, when the
empress Theodora at last overturned iconoclastic policies for good upon
the death of her husband, the emperor Theophilus (r. 829--843). From
this point forward, historians usually refer to the Greek-speaking
churches of the eastern Mediterranean and those churches following the

Although the iconoclast emperors had made enemies in the Church, they
were often effective military commanders, and they managed to stabilize
the frontiers with Arabs, Slavs, and Bulgars. Byzantine armies of the
eighth century would have some successes against Arabs and Slavs, but
Byzantium increasingly lost control of Italy. While a Byzantine
**exarch**, or governor, in Ravenna (in northeastern Italy) would rule
the city of Rome, even these Italian territories were gradually lost.
Ravenna fell to the Lombards in 751; the duke of Naples ceased to
acknowledge the authority of the emperor in Constantinople in the 750s;
and the popes in Rome, long the de facto governors of the city, became
effectively independent from Byzantium in the 770s. The popes would
increasingly look to another power to secure their city: the Franks.

## 7.10 WESTERN EUROPE: THE RISE OF THE FRANKS {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

At the west end of the Mediterranean and in northern Europe, the kingdom
of the Franks would become the dominant power of the Christian kingdoms.
Justinian's armies had destroyed the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy in the
sixth-century Gothic War. A century and a half later, in 711, Arab
Muslim invaders from North Africa conquered the Visigoth kingdom in
Spain and established Muslim rule. From that time on, we refer to
Muslim-ruled Spain of the early Middle Ages as **al-Andalus**. The
destruction of these two kingdoms left the Franks as the dominant power
of Western Europe. They were already the premier power in northern Gaul,
but as the seventh century went on, they established themselves in
southern Gaul as well, gradually subordinating other Germanic peoples to
their rule.

The first dynasty of Frankish kings was known as the **Merovingians**,
so named for Merovech, a possibly legendary ancestor of Clovis, the
first Christian king of the Franks. The Franks' power grew in Western
Europe for several reasons. In the first place, the Frankish monarchy
had fewer civil wars than did that of the Visigoths. The Frankish
kingdom did face the weakness that it was sometimes divided among a
king's sons at his death (since Germanic peoples often looked at a
kingdom as the king's personal property), with warfare resulting within
the divided kingdom. Nevertheless, although the kingdom might be split
by inheritance and later reunited, there existed in general a strong
sense of legitimate dynastic succession. In addition, the Catholic
Church provided the Frankish monarchs with a sense of legitimacy as it
had since the days of Clovis.

But as the Frankish kingdom expanded, many elements of what had
characterized the Roman state continued to wither. One reason for this
decline was that the nature of warfare had changed in Western Europe.
Soldiers were no longer paid out of a government treasury; instead, they
were rewarded with lands whose surplus they would use to outfit
themselves with military equipment. The soldiers thus served as a
warrior aristocracy. Even those families who had been Roman elites took
up a military lifestyle in order to prosper in the new order. In
addition, the Frankish kings increasingly made use of a **pillage**
**and** **gift** system. In a pillage and gift system, a king or other
war leader rewards his loyal soldiers by granting them gifts that came
from the plunder of defeated enemies. With armies financed either by
pillage and gift or by the wealth of an individual aristocrat's lands,
the Frankish kingdom had little reason for maintaining taxation.
Moreover, the kingdom's great landowners who supported the monarchy had
a strong interest in seeing that they were not taxed efficiently; by the
580s, the Frankish government had simply ceased to update the old Roman
tax registers.

One role that would gain prominence among the Frankish monarchy was that
of the **Major Domo**, or **Mayor of the Palace**. The Mayor of the
Palace was a noble who would grant out lands and gifts on behalf of the
king and who would, in many cases, command the army. Gradually, one
family of these Mayors of the Palace would rise to prominence above all
other noble families in the Frankish kingdom: the **Carolingians.**

This dominant family's more prominent members were named Charles, which
in Latin is Carolus, hence the name Carolingians. By the mid-seventh
century, the Carolingians had come to hold the position of Mayor of the
Palace as a hereditary one. Over the early eighth century, the
Carolingian Mayors of the Palace had become the actual rulers of the
Frankish realm, while the Merovingian kings had little or no actual
power. The earliest significant Carolingian Major Domo to dominate the
Carolingian court was **Charles** **Martel** (r. 715--741). He was an
able and effective military commander who---even though he rewarded his
troops with lands taken from the Church---was able to show himself a
defender of the Christian religion by defeating a Muslim attack on Gaul
from al-Andalus in 732 at the **Battle of Tours**. In 738, he also
defeated the Saxons, who were at this point still largely pagans living
in the forests to the northeast of the Frankish kingdom. These victories
allowed Martel to present his family as defenders of the Church and of
the Christian religion in general.

Martel's successor, Pepin the Short (r. 741--68), would take the final
step towards wresting power away from the Merovingians and making his
family the kings of the Franks. He followed in Martel's footsteps in
using the Church to shore up his legitimacy. He wrote to Pope Zachary I
(r. 741--752), asking whether one who exercised the power of a king
should have that power or if instead the person with the name of king
should have that power. Pope Zachary answered that kingship should rest
with the person exercising its power---because a king ruled the earth on
behalf of God, so a king who was not properly ruling was not doing his
God-given duty. Thus the last Merovingian king was deposed by the
combined powers of the Carolingian Mayors of the Palace and the popes.
This close cooperation between Church and crown would go on to be a
defining feature of the Frankish monarchy.

The relationship between the papacy and the Carolingians not only
involved the popes legitimating Pepin's coup d'état but also included
the Carolingian monarchs providing military assistance to the popes.
Shortly after Zachary's letter allowing Pepin to seize power, Pepin
marched south to Italy to give the pope military assistance against the
Lombards. He took control of several cities and their surrounding
hinterlands and gave these cities as a gift to the papacy. The popes
would thus rule a set of territories in central Italy known as the
**Papal States** from Pepin's day until the mid-nineteenth century.

The greatest of the Carolingians was the figure we refer to as
**Charlemagne**, whose name means Charles the Great. As king of the
Franks, he spent nearly the entirety of his reign leading his army in
battle. To the southeast, he destroyed the khanate of the Avars, the
nomadic people who had lived by raiding the Byzantine Empire. To the
northeast of his realm, he subjugated the Saxons of Central Europe and
had them converted to Christianity---a sometimes brutal process. When
the Saxons rebelled in 782, he had 4,000 men executed in one day for
having returned to their old religion. To the south in Italy,
Charlemagne militarily conquered the Lombard kingdom and made himself
its king. The only area in which he was less successful was in his
invasion of al-Andalus. Although his forces seized control of several
cities and fortresses in northeastern Spain (to include places like
Barcelona), he was, on the whole, less successful against Spain's
Umayyad emirs. One reason for this lack of success was that, compared to
Charlemagne's other foes, al-Andalus was organized into a sophisticated
state, and so better able to resist him.

By the end of the eighth century, Charlemagne ruled nearly all of
Western Europe. Indeed, he ruled more of Western Europe than anyone
since the Roman emperors of four centuries before. In the winter of 800,
a mob expelled Pope Leo III from Rome. Charlemagne took his troops south
of the Alps and restored the pope to his position in the **Lateran**
palace, the palace complex to the northeast of Rome where the popes both
lived and conducted most of their business.

On Christmas Day in 800, Charlemagne was attending worship at St.
Peter's Church. During that ceremony, the pope placed a crown upon
Charlemagne's head and declared him to be Roman emperor. Historians are
not sure whether Charlemagne had planned this coronation or had simply
gone up to the pope for a blessing and was surprised by this crown. The
question of who had planned this coronation is controversial because the
pope's crowning the emperor could have been interpreted to mean that the
crown was the pope's to confer.

Indeed, it was around this time that a document known as the **Donation
of Constantine** appeared in Western Europe. This document was a
forgery---to this day, scholars do not know who forged it---that claimed
to have been written by the Roman emperor Constantine (see Chapter Six).
According to this forged document, the emperor Constantine had been
cured of leprosy by Pope Sylvester I and, in thanks, had given the popes
authority over the Western Empire. Although false, this document would
go on to provide the popes with a claim to rule not just central Italy
but Western Europe as a whole.

Charlemagne's coronation by the pope marked the culmination of the
creation of a new society built on the wreck of the Western Roman
Empire. This new society would be Christian and based on close
cooperation of Church and State---although each would regard the others'
sphere of influence as separate.

## 7.11 GLOBAL CONTEXT {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Although Charlemagne possessed one of the most powerful armies in
Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East, his empire was hardly a
state compared to Tang China, the Abbasid Caliphate, or the Byzantine
Empire. Compared to the armies of the Byzantine emperors, the Abbasid
Caliphs, and above all, the Tang emperors, Charlemagne's army was merely
a very large war band, financed not by a state with a working system of
taxation and treasury but rather by the plunder of defeated enemies.
Although he issued decrees known as capitularies through the agencies of
Church and State, the realm had little in the way of either bureaucracy
or infrastructure, save for the decaying network of the Roman Empire's
roads. Indeed, although Charlemagne had sought to have a canal dug
between the Rhine and Danube Rivers, this project failed---a fitting
illustration of the gap between the ambitions of Charlemagne and the
reality.

### *7.11.1 The Carolingian Renaissance* {.import-Header3}

In those territories that had been part of the Western Roman Empire,
most of the people had spoken Latin, and Latin was the language of
literature. By the time of the Carolingians, Latin was starting to
change into the languages that would eventually become French, Spanish,
Italian, and Portuguese, languages that we call **Romance** because they
are descended from Latin, the language of the Romans. The Bible, the
liturgy, and writings on saints and theology, however, were still in
Latin. Even those who could read and write Latin, though, were less
skillful than their predecessors. There were fewer books of Roman
literature available in Western Europe; the copying of books gradually
dwindled with literacy.

The Carolingians were known not only for their conquests and attempted
revival of the Roman Empire but also for their efforts to improve the
state of learning in the Carolingian Empire, particularly with respect
to the Bible, theology, and literature of Ancient Rome. They also sought
to increase the number of schools and books in the realm. Historians
refer to this effort as the **Carolingian Renaissance**. Historians call
it the Carolingian Renaissance in order to distinguish it from the later
Italian Renaissance, an effort by northern Italian artists and writers
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to restore teaching and
learning of the literature of Ancient Greece and Rome.

Charlemagne and his successors sponsored an increase in learning by the
Church to promote moral reform. Charlemagne, like his predecessors and
successors, considered himself a defender and protector of the Christian
religion. As such, he wanted to make sure that the Church was promoting
moral reform. This would need to start with clergy, and these clergy
would need to be able to adequately read the Bible and other texts.

Charlemagne's efforts would be centered on schools and centers of book
production, what scholars of medieval Europe call **scriptoria**
(singular **scriptorium**). There were already high-quality schools
attached to monasteries in his empire, including many established by
English and Irish monks. The main school of his empire was the school in
his palace at Aachen. His palace itself was based on Roman and Byzantine
architecture, as a demonstration that he possessed the same sort of
legitimacy as the Roman emperors. He invited some of the best scholars
of Western Europe to his court---including **Alcuin** **of** **York**
(735--804), a monk from England---in order both to supervise his own
court school and to direct the Church of the Frankish Empire to improve
learning.

This improvement of learning included the establishment of new cathedral
schools, schools attached to a **cathedral church** (i.e., a church
where the bishop of a diocese---the basic geographic division of the
Church---has his seat). These schools trained not only men and women
from the church but also the children of Frankish aristocrats, and in
some cases women as well as men. As a result, an increasing number of
Frankish nobles would be literate or at least would sponsor efforts by
schools to further train people.

Likewise, under the guidance of Charlemagne and the Frankish church,
scriptoria throughout his empire launched a massive effort to copy new
books. Many of these books were religious in character, although
Carolingian monks (and nuns) would also copy books from Ancient Rome
that had been written by pagans. Many of these ancient books, like the
poetry of Virgil (see Chapter Six), would serve as the basis of the
curriculum of Western Europe's schools as they had since the Roman
Empire. A Christian of the eighth century would believe that even works
by pagans would afford their readers education and, thus,
self-improvement.

### *7.11.2 The Macedonian Renaissance* {.import-Header3}

The Byzantine Empire had been that half of the Roman Empire where the
language of life and culture was not Latin but Greek. At around the same
time as the Carolingians' efforts, the Byzantine Church and State
cooperated to revive the study of ancient literature and improve
learning. The Byzantine Empire had suffered from a collapse of literacy,
which, while not as severe as Western Europe's, had still resulted in a
much less literate population. As such, a similar renaissance of
learning was needed in the Greek-speaking Eastern Mediterranean. We call
this effort the **Macedonian** **Renaissance** because it reached its
fullest expression under a dynasty of Byzantine emperors that we call
the **Macedonian Dynasty** (867--1056).

The efforts of the Macedonian Dynasty, however, had begun earlier. The
efforts to improve the availability of books and to increase learning
began during the Iconoclast Controversy as both Iconophiles and
Iconoclasts had sought to back up their positions by quoting from the
Bible and the Church Fathers. Emperor Theophilus (r. 829--842), one of
the last Iconoclast emperors, asked Leo the Mathematician to found a
school in the emperor's palace in Constantinople. Like Charlemagne's
palace at Aachen, this school would serve as the foundation for a
revived learning among elites, only this learning was in Greek rather
than Latin.

</figure>

Following the final triumph of the Iconophiles, these efforts continued
with Photius, patriarch of Constantinople from 858 to 867 and 877 to
886. He sponsored monastic schools in the Byzantine Empire and the
copying of books in Ancient Greek, particularly Plato's philosophy and
the epic poetry of Homer.

### *7.11.3 Comparisons with the Abbasids* {.import-Header3}

We should also note the global context of both the Carolingian and the
Macedonian Renaissance. Carolingian and Macedonian Emperors were not
alone in seeking to increase the availability of Ancient Greek and Roman
texts. The Abbasid Caliphs under al-Mamun (r. 813--883) and his
successors also sponsored the work of the House of Wisdom, whose
scholars translated the philosophy of the Ancient Greeks into Arabic.
Like the Christians of the Carolingian and Byzantine Empires, the
Muslims of the Caliphate believed that one could learn from pagan
writers even if they had not believed in the one Creator God.

## 7.12 DAILY LIFE IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE BYZANTINE EMPIRES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In both Western Europe and Byzantium, the vast majority of the
population were farmers. In Western Europe, some of these were
**dependent** **farmers**---farmers who lived on the lands of
aristocrats and gave much of their surplus to their landlords. But in
many villages, the majority of farmers might live on their own land and
even enjoy a form of self-government. Although some slavery
existed---especially in zones of conflict like the Mediterranean---the
workers on the estates of the Frankish aristocracy or those free and
independent farmers enjoyed greater freedom than had their Roman
counterparts. But life was precarious. Crop yields were low, at ratios
of around 3:1 (producing three times as much as was planted). The
average Carolingian farmer frequently did not get adequate calories.

So too did most of the population of the Byzantine Empire live in small
villages, living at a subsistence level and selling what rare surplus
they had. Byzantium, like its Western European counterpart, was
fundamentally rural.

The nobles of Western Europe were generally part of a warrior
aristocracy. These aristocrats often outfitted and equipped themselves
based on the wealth of their lands. Their values were those of service
to their king and loyalty and bravery in battle. Nobles would often not
live on their lands but follow the royal court, which would itself
travel from place to place rather than having a fixed location. Battle
may have been frequent, but until Charlemagne, the scale of battle was
often small, with armies numbering a few hundred at most.

Along with its warrior aristocracy, gender roles in the Frankish
kingdom---like those of the Roman Empire that came before it---reflected
a patriarchal society. The Christian religion generally taught that
wives were to submit to their husbands, and the men who wrote much of
the religious texts often thought of women in terms of weakness and
temptation to sexual sin. "You," an early Christian writer had exclaimed
of women, "are the devil's gateway...you are the first deserter of the
divine law...you destroyed so easily God's image,
man..."[^\[3\]^](#chapter-007-unknown-5.xhtml_footnote-426-3 "Tertullian, On the Apparel of Women, 1:1."){#chapter-007-unknown-5.xhtml_return-footnote-426-3
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 3"} The warlike values of the aristocracy
meant that aristocratic women were relegated to a supporting role, to
the management of the household. Both Roman and Germanic law placed
women in subordination to their fathers and then, when married, to their
husbands.

That said, women did enjoy certain rights. Although legally inferior to
men in Roman Law (practiced in the Byzantine Empire and often among
those peoples who were subjects of the Germanic aristocracies), a wife
maintained the right to any property she brought into a marriage. Women
often played a strong economic role in peasant life, and as with their
aristocratic counterparts, peasant women often managed the household
even if men performed tasks such as plowing and the like. And the Church
gave women a fair degree of autonomy in certain circumstances. We often
read of women choosing to become nuns, to take vows of celibacy, against
the desires of their families for them to marry. These women, if they
framed their choices in terms of Christian devotion, could often count
on institutional support for their life choices. Although monasticism
was usually limited to noblewomen, women who became nuns often had
access to an education. Certain noblewomen who became abbesses could
even become powerful political actors in their own right, as did
Gertrude of Nivelles (c. 621--659), abbess of the monastery of Nivelles
in what is today Belgium.

## 7.13 CAROLINGIAN COLLAPSE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Charlemagne's efforts to create a unified empire did not long outlast
Charlemagne himself. His son, Louis the Pious (r. 814--840), succeeded
him as emperor. Unlike Charlemagne, who had had only one son to survive
into adulthood, Louis had three. In addition, his eldest, Lothar, had
already rebelled against him in the 830s. When Louis died, Lothar went
to war with Louis's other two sons, Charles the Bald and Louis the
German. This civil war proved to be inconclusive, and at the 843 Treaty
of Verdun, the Carolingian Empire was divided among the brothers.
Charles the Bald took the lands in the west of the Empire, which would
go on to be known first as West Francia and then, eventually, France. To
the east, the largely German-speaking region of Saxony and Bavaria went
to Louis the German. Lothar, although he had received the title of
emperor, received only northern Italy and the land between Charles's and
Louis's kingdoms.

This division of a kingdom was not unusual for the Franks---but it meant
that there would be no restoration of a unified Empire in the West,
although both the king of Francia and the rulers of Central Europe would
each claim to be Charlemagne's successors.

Western Europe faced worse problems than civil war between the
descendants of Charlemagne. In the centuries following the rise of the
post-Roman Germanic kingdoms, Western Europe had suffered comparatively
few invasions. The ninth and tenth centuries, by contrast, would be an
"age of invasions."

In the north of Europe, in the region known as Scandinavia, a people
called the Norse had lived for centuries before. These were Germanic
peoples, but one whose culture was not assimilated to the post-Roman
world of the Carolingian west. They were still pagan and had a culture
that, like that of other Germanic peoples, was quite warlike. Their
population had increased; additionally, Norse kings tended to exile
defeated enemies. These Norsemen would often take up raiding other
peoples, and when they did so, they were known as **Vikings**.

One factor that allowed Norse raids on Western Europe was an improvement
in their construction of ships. Their ships were long and flexible and
had a shallow enough draft that they did not need harbors. They could
land on any beach, and they could sail up rivers for hundreds of miles.
This meant that Norse Vikings could strike almost anywhere, often with
very little warning.

Even more significant for the Norse attacks was that Western Europe in
the ninth and tenth centuries was made up of weak states. The three
successor kingdoms to Charlemagne's empire were often split by civil
war. Although King Charles the Bald (r. 843--877) enjoyed some successes
against the Vikings, his realm was subject to frequent raids. England's
small kingdoms were particularly vulnerable. From 793, England suffered
numerous Viking raids, and these raids increased in size and scope over
the ninth century. Ireland, with its chiefs and petty kings, also lacked
the organization necessary to resist sustained incursions.

The result was that Viking raids on the British Isles increased in scope
and intensity over the ninth century. Eventually, the Norse captured
land there for permanent settlement.

To the south and west, al-Andalus suffered fewer Norse attacks than did
the rest of Europe. A sophisticated, organized state with a regular army
and a network of fortresses, it was able to effectively deal with
raiders. The Spanish emir Abd-al Rahman II defeated a Viking raid and
sent the Moroccan ambassador the severed heads of 200 Vikings to show
how successful he had been in defending against them.

To the east, the Norse sailed along the rivers that stretched through
the forests and steppes of the area that today makes up Russia and
Ukraine. The Slavic peoples living there had a comparatively weak social
organization, so in many instances, they fell under Norse domination.
The Norsemen Rurik and Oleg were said to have established themselves as
rulers of Slavic peoples as well as the princedoms of Novgorod and Kyiv,
respectively, in the ninth century. These kingdoms of Slavic subjects
and Norse rulers became known as the **Rus.**

Further to the south, the Norse would often move their ships over land
between rivers until finally reaching the Black Sea and thus
Constantinople and Byzantium. Although the Norse were occasionally
successful in raiding Constantinople, the powerful and organized
Byzantine state was generally able to defend itself.

Norse invaders were not the only threat faced by Western Europe. As the
emirs of Muslim North Africa gradually broke away from the centralized
rule of the Abbasid Caliphate (see Chapter Eight), these emirs turned to
legitimate themselves by raid and plunder. This aggression was often
directed at southern Francia and Italy. The Aghlabid emirs not only
seized control of Sicily but also sacked the city of Rome itself in 846.
North African raiders would often seize territory on the coasts of
Southern Europe and raid European shipping to control trade and
commerce. In addition, the emirs of these North African states would use
the plunder from their attacks to reward followers---another example of
the pillage and gift system.

Central Europe also faced attacks, these from the Magyars, a steppe
people. The Magyars had been forced out of Southeastern Europe by
another steppe people, the Pechenegs. From 899, the Magyars migrated
into Central Europe, threatening the integrity of East Francia. As was
the case with other steppe peoples, their raids on horseback targeted
people in small unfortified communities, avoiding larger settlements.
The Magyars eventually settled in the plains of Eastern Europe,
establishing the state of Hungary. Although they made Hungary their
primary location, they nevertheless continued to raid East Francia
through the first part of the tenth century.

### 7.13.1 An Age of Invasions in Perspective

Norse, Magyar, and Muslim attacks on Europe wrought incredible damage.
Thousands died, and tens of thousands more were captured and sold into
slavery in the great slave markets of North Africa and the Kyivan Rus.
These raids furthered the breakdown of public order in Western Europe,
but they also brought long-term economic benefits. Norse and Muslim
pirates traded as much as they raided. Indeed, even the plunder of
churches and selling of the gold and silver helped create new trade
networks in both the North Sea and Mediterranean. These new trade
networks, especially where the Norse had established settlements in
places like Ireland, gradually brought about an increase in economic
activity.

All told, we should remember this "age of invasions" in terms both of
its human cost and of the economic growth it brought about.

### 7.13.2 New States in Response to Invasions

In response to the invasions that Europe faced, newer, stronger states
came into being in the British Isles and in Central Europe. In England,
Norse invasions had destroyed all but one of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.
The only remaining kingdom was Wessex. Its king, Alfred the Great (r.
871--899), was able to stop Norse incursions by raising an army and navy
financed by a kingdom-wide tax. This tax, known as the geld, was also
used to finance the construction of a network of fortresses along the
frontier of those parts of England still controlled by the Norse. This
new system of tax collection would mean that England, a small island on
the periphery, would eventually have the most sophisticated bureaucracy
in Western Europe.

Likewise, in Central Europe, the kings of East Francia gradually built a
kingdom capable of dealing with Magyar invaders. Henry the Fowler (r.
919--936) took control of East Francia after the end of the Carolingian
Dynasty. He was succeeded by Otto the Great (r. 936--973), whose
creation of a state was partially the result of luck: his territory
contained large silver mines that allowed him to finance an army. This
army was able to decisively defeat the Magyar raiders. This allowed East
Francian kings to expand their power to the east, subjugating the Slavic
peoples living in the forests of Eastern Europe.

## 7.14 THE TENTH-CENTURY CHURCH {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

As a result of endemic chaos in Western Europe, the Church suffered as
well. The moral and intellectual quality of bishops and abbots declined
sharply, as church establishments fell under the domination of warlords.
These warlords would often appoint members of their families or personal
allies to positions of leadership in the Church, appointments based not
on competence or dedication to duty but rather on ties of loyalty. This
was even the case in Rome, where families of Roman nobles fought over
the papacy. Between 872 and 965, twenty-four popes were assassinated in
office.

## 7.15 BYZANTINE APOGEE: THE MACEDONIAN EMPERORS {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

For Byzantium, however, the ninth and tenth centuries represented a time
of recovery and expansion. This period included the height of the
Macedonian Renaissance, which brought a growth of learning among both
clergy and lay elites. This took place against a backdrop of military
success by the emperors of the Macedonian Dynasty (867--1056). The first
emperor of this dynasty, Basil I (r. 867--886), a soldier and servant of
the emperor, had come from a peasant background. He seized control of
the Empire when he murdered the reigning emperor and took the position
for himself.

Basil was an effective emperor. To the east, as the Abbasid Caliphate
broke down, he inflicted several defeats on the Arab emirs on the
border, pushing the frontiers of the Empire further east. Although
unsuccessful in fighting to maintain control of Sicily, he
re-established Byzantine control over most of southern Italy.

It was under the Macedonian emperors that the Eastern Orthodox culture
of the Byzantines spread north beyond the borders of the Empire. In 864,
the Bulgar khan, whose predecessors had been building a state of their
own, converted to Christianity and was baptized. This conversion allowed
the Bulgar state to be legitimated by the Church in the same manner as
the Byzantine Empire and the kingdoms of Western Europe.

In the ninth century, **Cyril and Methodius**, missionaries from the
city of Thessalonica, preached Orthodox Christianity to the Slavic
peoples of Eastern Europe. They also devised the alphabet that we call
**Cyrillic** in order to write the Bible and liturgy in the language of
Eastern Europe, **Slavonic**. By bringing Orthodox Christianity to the
Slavic peoples, the Byzantines brought them into the culture of the
Byzantines.

Subsequent emperors maintained this record of successes. John Tzimisces
(r. 969--976) established Byzantine control over most of Syria. Basil II
(r. 976--1025) achieved further successes, crushing and annexing the
neighboring Bulgar state and subordinating the Armenian kingdoms to the
Byzantine emperor. By the end of his reign, the Byzantine territory
encompassed about a fourth of what had been the Roman Empire at its
height. Basil II had further diplomatic triumphs. He allied with the
princes of the **Kyivan** **Rus**, a state that had grown up in Eastern
Europe along the rivers between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. The
Rus population was largely Slavic, with rulers who were ethnically
Norse; it was already a hybrid culture. An alliance with the Byzantine
Empire also brought Greek elements into the cultural mix. In 988, Kyivan
Grand Prince Vladimir (r. 980--1015) was baptized into the Christian
religion and became a close ally of Basil II, sealing the alliance by
marrying Basil's sister, Anna. The elite culture of the Rus would come
to reflect both Greek, Slavic, Norse, and Turkic elements. Allying with
these people had brought Basil II to the height of the Byzantine state's
power.

Despite its successes during the reign of the Macedonian emperors, the
Byzantine state faced weaknesses. The *theme* system gradually broke
down. Increasingly, soldiers came not from the themes but from the ranks
of professional mercenaries, to include those made up of Norsemen. The
soldiers of the themes received less training and served mainly as a
militia that would back up the core of a professional army, known as the
Tagmata. Whether the smaller *tagmata* would be up to the task of
defending an empire the size of Byzantium would remain to be seen.

## [7.16 CONCLUSION AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES]{style="font-size: 1em;"} {.import-CaptionText}

::: __UNKNOWN__
In many ways, the period between 500 and 1000 was as transitional for
Western Europe and Byzantium as it was for East Asia and the Middle East
and North Africa. Just as the Han State had fragmented politically in
the third century and given rise to smaller states ruled by warrior
aristocracies, so too had Rome fragmented into an eastern half and a
series of Germanic kingdoms, themselves ruled by warrior aristocracies.
Just as Mahayana Buddhism had arrived in post-Han China, so too had
Christianity become the dominant faith of the Roman Empire and its
successors.

And yet, these similarities are superficial. All of China's successor
states maintained a continuity of bureaucracy and literacy to an extent
that Western Europe did not. Moreover, although Mahayana Buddhism would
become a key element of East Asian culture, it would never come to enjoy
the monopoly of power that Christianity enjoyed in Western Europe and
Byzantium and that Islam enjoyed in Spain, the Middle East, and North
Africa. The less exclusivist nature of Mahayana Buddhism would mean that
it would always be one set of practices among many.

And the greatest difference is that China eventually saw a return to a
unified empire under the Sui and then Tang Dynasties. In spite of
Charlemagne's efforts to create a new Empire in the west, the story of
Western Europe would be one of competing states rather than an empire
claiming universal authority.

## 8.2 INTRODUCTION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In the fourteenth century, **Ibn Khaldun** was born in present-day
Tunisia. He received a traditional Islamic education until his parents
died from the plague. At the time of their deaths, he was just seventeen
years old. On his own, the young and resourceful Ibn Khaldun exploited
personal relationships to secure an administrative position at court and
thus began his lifetime career. Time and time again, Ibn Khaldun landed
in prison for his role in conspiracies against various ruling dynasties,
only to be released later. Envoys and grandees recognized his remarkable
intelligence and the value of his council. His reputation preceded him,
and many dignitaries openly asked him to join their court. Serving
various dynasties, Ibn Khaldun held many important offices, like
diplomat, court advisor, and prime minister. But he eventually grew
weary of the hazards of palace intrigue and sought instead a more
reclusive lifestyle.

Ibn Khaldun retired to the safety of a Berber tribe in Algeria, where he
composed *Prolegomenon*, an outstanding work of sociology and
historiography. Published in 1377, he theorized that tribal
'***asabiyah***, roughly translated as "social solidarity," is often
accompanied by a novel religious ideology that helps a previously
marginalized group of people, usually from the desert, rise up and
conquer the city folk. Once ensconced in power, these desert peoples
evolved into a grand civilization, but '*asabiyah* contained within it
destructive elements that could precipitate their collapse. Known for
this **Cyclical Theory of History**, Ibn Khaldun argued that, seduced by
the attractions of urban culture, the dominant group would over time
become soft and enter into a period of decay, until a new group of
desert peoples conquered them, when the process would begin anew. This
theory applies to the development of Islamic history discussed
throughout this chapter.

## 8.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

- How does geography play a role in Islamic history?
- Why were the concepts defined by *muruwah* so important to the early
  development of Islam?
- What are the Five Pillars of Islam, and why are they important to the
  religion?
- What were the five roles that the Prophet Muhammad played in Medina?
- What factors led to the rapid expansion of Islam?
- How did the Umayyads come to power following the Rashidun caliphs?
- Describe the transition from the Umayyads to the Abbasids. Compare and
  contrast the two caliphates.
- The Fatimids marked the end to the High Caliphate. How did Egypt gain
  its autonomy from the Abbasids? How did the Fatimids take over Egypt?
- How did the Crusaders gain a foothold in the Middle East? What did it
  take for Salah al-Din to push them out?
- What led to the establishment of the Mamluk Sultanate? How did the
  Mamluk Sultanate go into decline?
- Does North African history move in cycles of birth, renewal,
  expansion, and decadence? Ibn Khaldoun says that nomads come from the
  frontiers, desert, and periphery, settle down, and within 120 years,
  become decadent and collapse. Do you agree?

## 8.5 GEOGRAPHY OF THE MIDDLE EAST {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Academics have not reached a consensus on the geographical boundaries of
the Middle East. However, for the purposes of this chapter, this region
will encompass the broadly defined areas known as Persia, Mesopotamia,
the Levant, Asia Minor, and the Arabian Peninsula. The Middle East
straddles three continents, including Asia, Africa, and Europe. The
geography of the area promoted cultural diffusion by facilitating the
spread of peoples, ideas, and goods along overland and maritime trade
routes. In an area generally characterized by its aridity, climate has
influenced settlement patterns. Larger settlements were found in river
valleys and well-watered areas along the littoral. In these areas, we
see the development and spread of productive agriculture.

## 8.6 ARABIA BEFORE ISLAM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Legend traces the Arabs back to Isma'il, the son of Abraham and his
Egyptian maid, Haga, a link that would later help to legitimize Islam by
connecting it to the Hebrew tradition. In reality, Arabs inhabited the
pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula and shared socio-linguistic commonalities
with such other Semitic-speaking peoples in the area as the Hebrews,
Assyrians, Arameans, and even the Amhara of Ethiopia. For much of
ancient history, Arabia was an unorganized land between the great
empires of Mesopotamia and the Egyptian kingdom of the pharaohs. From
the beginning of the first millennium BCE, Southern Arabia was home to a
number of kingdoms, such as the Sabaean kingdom, while Eastern Arabian
lands were controlled by the Iranian Parthians and Sassanians from 300
BCE.

The nomadic pastoralist Bedouin tribes inhabited the Arabian Peninsula
before the rise of Islam. The population was thinly spread out across
the entire peninsula. Society was patriarchal, and life was centered
around the tribe, a group of relatives who claimed a shared ancestry.
Tribes provided a means of protection for their members; death to one
clan member meant brutal retaliation. Because of the harsh climate and
the seasonal migrations required to obtain resources, the Bedouin tribes
generally raised sheep, goats, and camels. Each member of the family had
a specific role in taking care of the animals, from guarding the herd to
making cheese from milk. The Bedouin also hunted, served as bodyguards,
escorted caravans, and worked as mercenaries. Some tribes traded with
towns in order to gain goods, while others raided other tribes for
animals, women, gold, fabric, and other luxury items. In pre-Islamic
Arabia, women's status varied widely according to the laws and cultural
norms of the tribes in which they lived, but one thing they had in
common was the lack of any legal status. Women were often considered
property to be inherited or seized in a tribal conflict. Not unique to
Arabia, there were also instances of abuse of women and girls, including
instances of killing female infants if they were considered a liability.

Like later cultures in the region, the Bedouin tribes placed heavy
importance on poetry and oral tradition as a means of communication.
Poetry was used to communicate within the community and sometimes
promoted tribal propaganda. Tribes constructed verses against their
enemies, often discrediting their people or fighting abilities. Poets
maintained sacred places in their communities because they were thought
to be divinely inspirited. Poets often wrote in classical Arabic, which
differed from the common tribal dialect. Poetry was also a form of
entertainment, as many poets constructed prose about the nature and
beauty surrounding their nomadic lives.

Tribal traditions found meaning in the poetic concept of ***muruwah***,
which represented the notion of the ideal tribal man. This uniquely
Arabian brand of chivalry focused on bravery, patience, persistence in
revenge, generosity, hospitality, and protection of the poor and weak.
In the absence of formal government, tribes offered physical security to
their individual members. Tribes mitigated violence and theft through
the shared understanding that retribution for such acts would follow
swiftly. Tribes also organized to compete over increasingly scarce
resources, as they had a responsibility to provide for the economic
needs of their individual members. Nevertheless, tribal traditions had
been breaking down prior to the rise of Islam; no longer were the
dominant members of society adhering to the principles set forth in
*muruwah*.

Pre-Islamic religion in Arabia consisted of indigenous polytheistic
beliefs, Ancient Arabian Christianity, Nestorian Christianity, Judaism,
and Zoroastrianism. Christianity existed in the Arabian Peninsula and
was established first by the early Arab traders who were familiar with
Christianity. Many people in Arabia identified as "hanif," meaning they
followed a monotheistic version of the Abrahamic religion, not
considered Jewish or Christian, but more loosely organized.

Most of the population resided in the south of the peninsula, in
modern-day Yemen, where they practiced terraced agriculture and herded
animals in a relatively small area. Farther to the north of Yemen, along
the highland spine of western Arabia and up against the littoral of the
Red Sea, was the Hijaz, a prominent cultural and economic region.
Situated in this remote fastness was the dusty city of Mecca, the
holiest place in the peninsula. Mecca was also home to the **Ka'ba**, or
cube, which contained many of the traditional Arabian religious images,
including many Christian icons. So important was the Ka'ba to the
religion of polytheistic tribes of Arabia that they negotiated a truce
lasting one month every year that allowed for safe pilgrimage to the
shrine.

The Hijaz was the most arable part of the Arabian Peninsula and
distinguished by irrigated agriculture that supported fruit trees and
essential grains. Local traders exported a range of agricultural
products to Syria in the north in return for imports like textiles and
olive oil. Regional commerce depended on the security of trade, while
piracy on the Red Sea threatened to disrupt business. Under these
conditions, merchants diverted their trade overland. Caravans of camels
carried these goods, as well as Hijazi exports, to the Levant or the
eastern Mediterranean area. Most of the caravans stopped in Mecca, the
halfway point up the spine of the peninsula, thus their commerce brought
much-needed wealth and tax revenue to the city.

The Arabs first domesticated the dromedary camel probably sometime
between 3000 and 1000 BCE. Caravan operators eventually availed
themselves of these useful dromedaries because they were so adept at
crossing the region's massive deserts. Capable of drinking 100 liters of
water in mere minutes, they could endure days of travel without needing
to replenish themselves again. Moreover, camels instinctively remembered
the locations of important, life-sustaining oases. So important were
these beasts of burden that the tribes that controlled the camels
controlled the trade. And the Quraysh Tribe of Mecca commanded many of
the camels in the Hijaz region; therefore, they commanded much of the
trade.

## 8.7 RISE OF ISLAM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Into this heterogeneous and evolving cultural milieu Muhammad (c.
570--632) was born in the city of Mecca. Muhammad was orphaned at just
six years of age, but his tribe intervened to ensure Muhammad's
survival. His uncle, Abu Thalib, an important member of the Quraysh
Tribe, eventually took custody of the young boy. These early experiences
influenced Muhammad's later desire to take care of those who could not
care for themselves.

In his youth, Muhammad found employment in the regional caravan trade as
a dependable herder and driver of camels. During this period, he
cultivated a reputation of an empathetic and honest man, one who earned
the respect of many Meccans. His upright character soon attracted the
attention of a wealthy merchant known as Khadija, who hired Muhammad to
manage her caravans. Once Muhammad proved his reliability, Khadija, who
was fifteen years older than Muhammad, proposed to him, and they
married. This marriage afforded Muhammad a financial security that
allowed him to begin meditating on religion.

Muhammad had been concerned about the direction of society and the
decline of *muruwah,* or traditions of manhood. He believed that some of
the most influential members of society, namely the merchant elite of
the Quraysh Tribe, were no longer respecting their traditional
responsibilities to guide the weaker members of society because of their
own greed. Muhammad had contact with many different cultures, including
**People of the Book**, specifically Christians and Jews. He even
traveled to Christian Syria while working in the caravan trade. In this
context, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad at a cave near Mecca in
610, during the holy month of Ramadan. The Angel Gabriel instructed him
to "recite," and then he spoke the divine word of God. His revelations
became the **Quran,** the sacred text of Islam.

At first, Muhammad displayed the very human reactions of fear and
distrust to the apparition of the Angel Gabriel. He also expressed
embarrassment because he did not want to be associated with the pagan
diviners of the region. Fortunately, his wife Khadija had a cousin who
was a *hanif* but who believed in a vague concept of a monotheistic god.
Her cousin trusted the veracity of Muhammad's revelations. So with
trepidation, Muhammad eventually accepted his role as God's vehicle. His
wife became the first convert to Islam, with Abu Thalib's son **'Ali**
converting soon afterwards.

The key themes of the Quran included the responsibility of man towards
his creator; the resurrection of the dead, God's final judgment followed
by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise;
and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties required
of the believers at this time were few: believing in God, asking for
forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, and assisting others,
particularly those in need. According to the Quran, one of the main
roles of Muhammad was to warn the unbelievers of their punishment at the
end of the world. The Quran does not explicitly refer to Judgment Day
but provides examples from the history of extinct communities and warns
Muhammad's contemporaries of similar calamities. Muhammad not only
warned those who rejected God's revelation but also dispensed good news
for those who abandoned evil, listened to the divine words, and served
God. Islam's mission also involves preaching monotheism; the Quran
commands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of his Lord and
instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God.

### 8.7.1 The Religion of Islam {.import-Header3}

As a religion of the Abrahamic faith, Islam holds much in common with
Judaism and Christianity. Islam grew out of the Judeo-Christian
tradition, a link which helped to legitimize the new religion. In fact,
Muslims believe in the same God, or Allah in Arabic, as the Jewish
Yahweh or the Christian God. Although Muslims trust that the People of
the Book had received the word of God, they believe that it had become
distorted over time, so God sent the Angel Gabriel to deliver His word
to Muhammad, and Muslims believe that he represented God's final word to
man. Muhammad never claimed to found a new religion; rather, he served
as the last in a long line of God's messengers, beginning with the
Hebrew prophets and including Jesus. His revelations, therefore,
represent the pure, unadulterated version of God's message. The
Prophet's followers memorized the revelations and ultimately recorded
them in a book called the Quran.

Together with the Quran, two additional sources helped guide Muslims on
proper behavior: the **Hadiths**, or the traditions of Muhammad, and the
**Sunna**, the teachings of the Prophet not found in the Quran. All of
these sacred texts provide examples and resources for Muslims, followers
of Islam, to help them make decisions. And with that knowledge comes
great responsibility, as God holds His people to a high standard of
behavior based on their obedience, or submission, to His will. In fact,
the word Islam means "submission" in Arabic, and a Muslim is one who
submits (to God).

Derived from a Hadith, the Five Pillars of Islam are essential,
obligatory actions that serve as the foundation of the faith.

1.  The first pillar is a profession of faith, known as ***shahada***,
    in which believers declare that "There is no God but God, and
    Muhammad is His messenger."
2.  Prayer, also called ***salat***, is the second pillar of Islam.
    Islam expects faithful Muslims to pray five times a day, kneeling
    towards Mecca, at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. One
    should perform ritual ablutions prior to their prayers in order to
    approach God as being symbolically clean and pure.
3.  The third pillar is almsgiving, or ***zakat*** in Arabic. Islam
    requires Muslims to contribute a proportion of their wealth to the
    upkeep of the Islamic community. This proportion, or tithe, accords
    with the size of one's wealth; therefore, the rich should expect to
    contribute more than the poor.
4.  Fasting, or ***sawm***, is the fourth pillar of Islam and takes
    place during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar.
    For the duration of **Ramadan**, believers consume neither food nor
    drink from dawn to dusk and generally eat minimally at other times.
    This practice is meant to remind them of what it is like to be poor
    and go hungry.
5.  The fifth and final pillar of Islam is pilgrimage, or ***hajj***.
    Islam expects all able-bodied Muslims to make a journey to Mecca at
    least once in their lifetime. All five pillars combine to unite the
    Islamic community.

## 8.8 THE GROWTH OF ISLAM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The Prophet Muhammad started publicly preaching his strict brand of
monotheism in the year 613 by reciting the Quran, quickly obtaining
followers. Most of his early converts belonged to groups of people who
had failed to achieve any significant social mobility, which, of course,
included many of the poor. His followers memorized his recitations and
message that called for the powerful to take care of the weak, a message
that resonated with many of these economically and socially marginalized
people. Islam served as a binding force, replacing tribal solidarity, or
*'asabiyah*.

### 8.8.1 Muhammad's Relations with the Tribes of Mecca {.import-Header3}

According to Ibn Sad, one of Muhammad's companions, the opposition in
Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship
and polytheism. However, the Quran maintains that it began when Muhammad
started public preaching. The ruling tribes of Mecca perceived Muhammad
as a danger that might cause tensions similar to the rivalry of Judaism
and Bedouin Polytheism in Yathrib. The powerful merchants in Mecca
attempted to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching by offering him
admission into the inner circle of merchants and an advantageous
marriage. However, Muhammad turned down both offers.

Muhammad's message of monotheism challenged the traditional social order
in Mecca. The Quraysh Tribe controlled the Kaaba and drew their
religious and political power from its polytheistic shrines, so they
began to persecute the Muslims, and many of Muhammad's followers became
martyrs. At first, the opposition was confined to ridicule and sarcasm
but later morphed into active persecution that forced a section of new
converts to migrate to neighboring Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia).
Upset by the rate at which Muhammad was gaining new followers, the
Quraysh proposed adopting a common form of worship, which was denounced
by the Quran.

Muhammad himself was protected from physical harm as long as he belonged
to the Banu Hashim clan, but his followers were not so lucky. Sumayyah
bint Khabbab, a slave of the prominent Meccan leader Abu Jahl, is famous
as the first martyr of Islam; her master killed her with a spear when
she refused to give up her faith. Bilal, another Muslim slave, was
tortured as more and more rocks were placed on his chest to force his
conversion, until he died.

Muhammad's wife Khadijah and uncle Abu Talib both died in 619 CE, the
year that became known as the "year of sorrow." With the death of Abu
Talib, Abu Lahab assumed leadership of the Banu Hashim clan. Soon after,
Abu Lahab withdrew the clan's protection from Muhammad, endangering him
and his followers. Muhammad took this opportunity to look for a new home
for himself and his followers. After several unsuccessful negotiations,
he found hope with some men from **Yathrib** (later called **Medina**).
They hoped, by the means of Muhammad and the new faith, to gain
supremacy over Mecca. A delegation from Medina, consisting of the
representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, invited
Muhammad as a neutral outsider to serve as the chief arbitrator for the
entire community. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and
their fellow citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and to
physically protect him as one of their own.

### 8.8.2 The Hijra {.import-Header3}

The Hijra is the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to
Medina, 320 kilometers (200 miles) north, in 622 CE. Muhammad instructed
his followers to emigrate to Medina until nearly all of them left Mecca.
According to tradition, the Meccans, alarmed at the departure, plotted
to assassinate Muhammad. In June 622, when he was warned of the plot,
Muhammad slipped out of Mecca with his companion, Abu Bakr.

On the night of his departure, Muhammad's house was besieged by the
appointed men of Quraysh. It is said that when Muhammad emerged from his
house, he recited a verse from the Quran and threw a handful of dust in
the direction of the besiegers, which prevented them from seeing him.
When the Quraysh learned of Muhammad's escape, they announced a large
reward for bringing him back to them, alive or dead, and pursuers
scattered in all directions. After an eight-day journey, Muhammad
entered the outskirts of Medina but did not enter the city directly. He
stopped at a place called Quba, some miles from the main city, and
established a mosque, which was the first mosque built. After a
fourteen-day stay at Quba, Muhammad started for Medina, participating in
his first Friday prayer on the way, and upon reaching the city was
greeted cordially by its people.

Among the first things Muhammad did to ease the longstanding grievances
among the tribes of Medina was draft a document known as the
Constitution of Medina, which created a kind of alliance or federation
among the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca. The
document specified rights and duties of all citizens and the
relationship of the different communities in Medina (including between
the Muslim community and other communities, specifically the Jews and
other People of the Book). The Islamic community, the *Ummah*, had a
religious outlook, also shaped by practical considerations, and
substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes. The
constitution instituted rights and responsibilities and united the
different Medina communities into the first Islamic state, the Ummah.

An important feature of the Constitution of Medina is the redefinition
of ties between Muslims. It set faith relationships above blood ties and
emphasized individual responsibility. Tribal identities were still
important and were used to refer to different groups, but the
constitution declared that the "main binding tie" for the newly created
Ummah was religion. This contrasts with the norms of pre-Islamic Arabia,
which was a thoroughly tribal society. This was an important event in
the development of the small group of Muslims in Medina to the larger
Muslim community and empire. While praying in Medina in 624 CE, Muhammad
received revelations that he should be facing Mecca rather than
Jerusalem during prayer. Muhammad adjusted to the new direction, and his
companions praying with him followed his lead, beginning the tradition
of facing Mecca during prayer.

Around 628 CE, the nascent Islamic state was somewhat consolidated when
Muhammad left Medina to perform pilgrimage at Mecca. The Quraysh
intercepted him enroute and made a treaty with the Muslims. Though the
terms of the Hudaybiyyah treaty may have been unfavorable to the Muslims
of Medina, the Quran declared it a clear victory. Muslim historians
suggest that the treaty mobilized the contact between the Meccan pagans
and the Muslims of Medina. The treaty demonstrated that the Quraysh
recognized Muhammad as their equal and Islam as a rising power.

### 8.8.3 The Expansion of Armed Conflict {.import-Header3}

Economically uprooted by their Meccan persecutors and with no available
profession, the Muslim migrants turned to raiding Meccan caravans. This
response to persecution and effort to provide sustenance for Muslim
families initiated armed conflict between the Muslims and the pagan
Quraysh of Mecca. Muhammad delivered Quranic verses permitting the
Muslims, "those who have been expelled from their homes," to fight the
Meccans in opposition to persecution. The caravan attacks provoked and
pressured Mecca by interfering with trade and allowed the Muslims to
acquire wealth, power, and prestige while working toward their ultimate
goal of inducing Mecca's submission to the new faith.

In March 624, Muhammad led three hundred warriors in a raid on a Meccan
merchant caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for the caravan at Badr, but
a Meccan force intervened, and the **Battle of** **Badr** commenced.
Although outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle,
killing at least forty-five Meccans. Muhammad and his followers saw the
victory as confirmation of their faith, and Muhammad said the victory
was assisted by an invisible host of angels. The victory strengthened
Muhammad's position in Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his
followers.

To maintain economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their
prestige after their defeat at Badr. Abu Sufyan, the leader of the
ruling Quraysh Tribe, gathered an army of 3,000 men and set out for an
attack on Medina. Muhammad led his Muslim force to the Meccans to fight
the **Battle of Uhud** on March 23, 625 CE. When the battle seemed close
to a decisive Muslim victory, the Muslim archers left their assigned
posts to raid the Meccan camp. Meccan war veteran Khalid ibn al-Walid
led a surprise attack, which killed many Muslims and injured Muhammad.
The Muslims withdrew up the slopes of Uḥud. The Meccans did not pursue
the Muslims further but marched back to Mecca declaring victory. For the
Muslims, the battle was a significant setback. According to the Quran,
the loss at Uhud was partly a punishment and partly a test for
steadfastness.

After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered
an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The
attack went largely uncontested, and Muhammad took over the city with
little bloodshed. Most Meccans converted to Islam. Muhammad declared an
amnesty for past offenses, except for ten men and women who had mocked
and made fun of him in songs and verses. Some of these people were later
pardoned. Muhammad destroyed the pagan idols in the Kaaba and then sent
his followers out to destroy all of the remaining pagan temples in
Eastern Arabia.

At the end of the 10th year after the migration to Medina, Muhammad
performed his first truly Islamic pilgrimage, thereby teaching his
followers the rules governing the various ceremonies of the annual Great
Pilgrimage. In 632, a few months after returning to Medina from the
Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and died. By the time Muhammad
died, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam, and he had
united Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity.

### 8.8.3 Muhammad's Successors and the Sunni / Shia Split {.import-Header3}

After Muhammad's death in 632 CE, there were conflicts among his
followers as to who would become his successor, which created a split in
Islam between the Sunni and Shi'a sects.

Muhammad united the tribes of Arabia into a single Arab Muslim religious
polity in the last years of his life. He established a new unified
Arabian Peninsula, which led to the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates and
the rapid expansion of Muslim power over the next century. In areas that
were previously under Sassanid Persian or Byzantine rule, the Rashidun
caliphs lowered taxes, provided greater local autonomy (to their
delegated governors), granted greater religious freedom for Jews and
some indigenous Christians, and brought peace to peoples demoralized and
disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the
decades of Byzantine-Persian warfare.

With Muhammad's death in 632 CE, disagreement broke out among his
followers over deciding his successor. Abu Bakr was confirmed as the
first caliph (religious successor to Muhammad) that same year. Once Abu
Bakr quelled the rebellions in Arabia, he began a war of conquest. In
just a few short decades, his campaigns led to one of the largest
empires in history. Muslim armies conquered most of Arabia by 633,
followed by north Africa, Mesopotamia, and Persia, significantly shaping
the history of the world through the spread of Islam.

However, the choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's
companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin and
son-in-law, had been designated the successor by Muhammad at Ghadir
Khumm. Ali would eventually become the fourth Sunni caliph. These
disagreements over Muhammad's true successor led to a major split in
Islam between what became the Sunni and Shi'a denominations, a division
that still holds to this day.

Sunni Muslims believe and confirm that Abu Bakr was chosen by the
community and that this was the proper procedure. Sunnis further argue
that a caliph should ideally be chosen by election or community
consensus. Shi'a Muslims believe that just as God alone appoints a
prophet, only God has the prerogative to appoint the successor to his
prophet. They believe God chose Ali to be Muhammad's successor and the
first caliph of Islam.

### 8.8.4 The Umayyad Caliphate (661--750) {.import-Header3}

The Umayyad Caliphate, the second of the four major Arab caliphates
established after the death of Muhammad, expanded the territory of the
Islamic state to one of the largest empires in history. This caliphate
was centered on the Umayyad dynasty, hailing from Mecca. The Umayyad
family had first come to power under the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan
(r. 644--656), but the Umayyad regime was founded by Muawiya after the
end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661 CE. Syria remained the
Umayyads' main power base thereafter, and Damascus was their capital.

Under the Umayyads, the caliphate territory grew rapidly. The Islamic
Caliphate became one of the largest unitary states in history and one of
the few states to ever extend direct rule over three continents (Africa,
Europe, and Asia). The Umayyads incorporated the Caucasus, Transoxiana,
Sindh, the Maghreb, and the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the
Muslim world. At its greatest extent, the Umayyad Caliphate covered 5.79
million square miles and included 62 million people (29% of the world's
population), making it the fifth largest empire in history in both area
and proportion of the world's population. Although the Umayyad Caliphate
did not rule all of the Sahara, nomadic Berber tribes paid homage to the
caliph. However, although these vast areas may have recognized the
supremacy of the caliph, de facto power was in the hands of local
sultans and emirs.

<figcaption>Map 8.5: Map of Islamic Expansion, 620–638. Author: User

</figure>

The Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within the Muslim
community for a variety of reasons, including their hereditary election
and suggestions of impious behavior. Some Muslims felt that only members
of Muhammad's Banu Hashim clan or those of his own lineage, such as the
descendants of Ali, should rule. Some Muslims thought that Umayyad
taxation and administrative practices were unjust. While the non-Muslim
population had autonomy, their judicial matters were dealt with in
accordance with their own laws and by their own religious heads or their
appointees. Non-Muslims paid a poll tax for policing to the central
state. Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that each
religious minority should be allowed to practice its own religion and
govern itself, and the policy had on the whole continued.

There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads, as well as splits
within the Umayyad ranks, which notably included the rivalry between
Yaman and Qays. Allegedly, the Sunnis killed Ali's son Hussein and his
family at the **Battle of Karbala** in 680, solidifying the Shi'a-Sunni
split. Eventually, supporters of the Banu Hashim and the supporters of
the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750. However,
the Shiʻat ʻAlī, "the Party of Ali," were again disappointed when the
Abbasid dynasty took power, as the Abbasids were descended from
Muhammad's uncle \`Abbas ibn \`Abd al-Muttalib, not from Ali.

The Abbasid victors desecrated the tombs of the Umayyads in Syria,
sparing only that of Umar II, and most of the remaining members of the
Umayyad family were tracked down and killed. When Abbasids declared
amnesty for members of the Umayyad family, eighty gathered to receive
pardons, and all were massacred. One grandson of Hisham, Abd al-Rahman
I, survived and established a kingdom in Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia,
today in Spain), proclaiming his family to be the Umayyad Caliphate
revived.

#### Umayyad Dynasty in Cordoba, Spain

The revival of the Umayyad Caliphate in Al-Andalus (what would become
modern Spain) was called the Caliphate of Córdoba, which lasted until
1031. The period was characterized by an expansion of trade and culture
and saw the construction of masterpieces of al-Andalus architecture.

The caliphate enjoyed increased prosperity during the 10th century.
Abd-ar-Rahman III united al-Andalus and brought the Christian kingdoms
of the north under control through force and diplomacy. Abd-ar-Rahman
stopped the Fatimid advance into caliphate land in Morocco and
al-Andalus. This period of prosperity was marked by increasing
diplomatic relations with Berber tribes in north Africa, Christian kings
from the north, and France, Germany, and Constantinople.

Córdoba was the cultural and intellectual center of al-Andalus. Mosques,
such as the Great Mosque, were the focus of many caliphs' attention. The
caliph's palace, Medina Azahara, was on the outskirts of the city and
had many rooms filled with riches from the East. The library of Al-Ḥakam
II was one of the largest libraries in the world, housing at least
400,000 volumes, and Córdoba possessed translations of ancient Greek
texts into Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew. During the Umayyad Caliphate
period, relations between Jews and Arabs were cordial; Jewish
stonemasons helped build the columns of the Great Mosque. Al-Andalus was
subject to eastern cultural influences as well. The musician Ziryab is
credited with bringing hair and clothing styles, toothpaste, and
deodorant from Baghdad to the Iberian Peninsula. Advances in science,
history, geography, philosophy, and language occurred during the Umayyad
Caliphate as well.

#### Legacy of the Umayyad Caliphate

The Umayyad Caliphate was marked both by territorial expansion and by
the administrative and cultural problems that such expansion created.
Despite some notable exceptions, the Umayyads tended to favor the rights
of the old Arab families and their own over those of newly converted
Muslims (mawali). Therefore, they held to a less universalist conception
of Islam than did many of their rivals.

During the period of the Umayyads, Arabic became the administrative
language, in which state documents and currency were issued. Mass
conversions brought a large influx of Muslims to the caliphate. The
Umayyads also constructed famous buildings such as the Dome of the Rock
at Jerusalem and the Umayyad Mosque at Damascus.

According to one common view, the Umayyads transformed the caliphate
from a religious institution (during the Rashidun) to a dynastic one.
However, the Umayyad caliphs saw themselves as the representatives of
God on Earth.

The Umayyads have met with a largely negative reception from later
Islamic historians, who have accused them of promoting a kingship
(*mulk*, a term with connotations of tyranny) instead of a true
caliphate (*khilafa*). In this respect, it is notable that the Umayyad
caliphs referred to themselves not as *khalifat* *rasul*
*Allah *("successor of the messenger of God," the title preferred by the
tradition) but rather as *khalifat* *Allah* ("deputy of God").

Many Muslims criticized the Umayyads for having too many non-Muslim,
former Roman administrators in their government. St. John of Damascus
was also a high administrator in the Umayyad administration. As the
Muslims took over cities, they left the people's political
representatives and the Roman tax collectors and administrators. The
people's political representatives calculated and negotiated taxes. The
central government and the local governments were paid respectively for
the services they provided. Many Christian cities used some of the taxes
to maintain their churches and run their own organizations. Later, some
of the Muslims criticized the Umayyads for not reducing the taxes of the
people who converted to Islam.

## 8.9 THE SPREAD OF ISLAM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In the years following the Prophet Muhammad's death, the expansion of
Islam was carried out by his successor caliphates, who increased the
territory of the Islamic state and sought converts from both
polytheistic and monotheistic religions.

The expansion of the Arab Empire in the years following the Prophet
Muhammad's death led to the creation of caliphates occupying a vast
geographical area. Conversion to Islam was boosted by missionary
activities, particularly those of Imams, or prayer leaders, who easily
intermingled with local populace to propagate religious teachings. These
early caliphates, coupled with Muslim economics and trading and the
later expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in Islam's spread
outwards from Mecca towards both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the
creation of the Muslim world. Trading played an important role in the
spread of Islam in several parts of the world, notably southeast Asia.

Muslim dynasties were soon established, and subsequent empires such as
those of the Abbasids, Fatimids, Almoravids, Seljukids, Ajurans, Adal,
and Warsangali in Somalia, Mughals in India, Safavids in Persia, and
Ottomans in Anatolia were among the largest and most powerful in the
world. The people of the Islamic world created numerous sophisticated
centers of culture and science with far-reaching mercantile networks,
travelers, scientists, hunters, mathematicians, doctors, and
philosophers, all contributing to the Golden Age of Islam. Islamic
expansion in South and East Asia fostered cosmopolitan and eclectic
Muslim cultures in the Indian subcontinent, Malaysia, Indonesia, and
China.

Within the first century of the establishment of Islam upon the Arabian
Peninsula and the subsequent rapid expansion of the Arab Empire during
the Muslim conquests, one of the most significant empires in world
history was formed. For the subjects of this new empire, formerly
subjects of the greatly reduced Byzantine and obliterated Sassanid
empires, not much changed in practice. The objective of the conquests
was of a practical nature more than anything else, as fertile land and
water were scarce in the Arabian Peninsula. A real Islamization
therefore only came about in the subsequent centuries.

### 8.9.1 Policy Toward Non-Muslims {.import-Header3}

The Arab conquerors did not repeat the mistake made by the Byzantine and
Sasanian empires, who had tried and failed to impose an official
religion on subject populations, which had caused resentments that made
the Muslim conquests more acceptable to them. Instead, the rulers of the
new empire generally respected the traditional Middle-Eastern pattern of
religious pluralism, which
was [one]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}not of
equality but rather of dominance by one group over the others. After the
end of military operations, which involved the sacking of some
monasteries and confiscation of Zoroastrian fire temples in Syria and
Iraq, the early caliphate was characterized by religious tolerance, and
people of all ethnicities and religions blended in public life. Before
Muslims were ready to build mosques in Syria, they accepted Christian
churches as holy places and shared them with local Christians. In Iraq
and Egypt, Muslim authorities cooperated with Christian religious
leaders. Numerous churches were repaired and new ones built during the
Umayyad era.

Some non-Muslim populations did experience persecution, however. After
the Muslim conquest of Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi
(non-Muslim) status and subjected to persecutions; discrimination and
harassment began in the form of sparse violence. Zoroastrians were made
to pay an extra tax called Jizya; if they failed, they were killed,
enslaved, or imprisoned. Those paying Jizya were subjected to insults
and humiliation by the tax collectors. Zoroastrians who were captured as
slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam.

## 8.10 THE ISLAMIC GOLDEN AGE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Abbasid leadership cultivated intellectual, cultural, and scientific
developments in the Islamic Golden Age. The Islamic Golden Age refers to
a period in the history of Islam, traditionally dated from the 8th
century to the 13th century, during which much of the historically
Islamic world was ruled by various caliphates and science, economic
development, and cultural works flourished. This period is traditionally
understood to have begun during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun
al-Rashid (786--809) with the inauguration of the House of Wisdom in
Baghdad, where scholars from various parts of the world with different
cultural backgrounds were mandated to gather and translate the world's
classical knowledge into the Arabic language.

The end of the age is variously given as 1258 with the Mongolian Sack of
Baghdad or 1492 with the completion of the Christian Reconquista of the
Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus, Iberian Peninsula. During the Golden
Age, the major Islamic capital cities of Baghdad, Cairo, and Córdoba
became the main intellectual centers for science, philosophy, medicine,
and education. The government heavily patronized scholars, and the best
scholars and notable translators, such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, had salaries
estimated to be the equivalent of those of professional athletes today.

The School of Nisibis and later the School of Edessa became centers of
learning and transmission of classical wisdom. The House of Wisdom was a
library, translation institute, and academy, and the Library of
Alexandria and the Imperial Library of Constantinople housed new works
of literature. Nestorian Christians played an important role in the
formation of Arab culture, with the Jundishapur hospital and medical
academy prominent in the late Sassanid, Umayyad, and early Abbasid
periods.

### 8.10.1 Literature and Philosophy {.import-Header3}

Christians (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab
Islamic civilization during the Umayyad and the Abbasid periods by
translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and then to Arabic.
During the 4th through the 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Syriac
and Greek languages was either newly initiated or carried on from the
Hellenistic period. Many classic works of antiquity might have been lost
if Arab scholars had not translated them into Arabic and Persian and
later into Turkish, Hebrew, and Latin. Islamic scholars also absorbed
ideas from China and India, and in turn, Arabic philosophic literature
contributed to the development of modern European philosophy.

With the introduction of paper, information was democratized, and it
became possible to make a living from simply writing and selling books.
The use of paper spread from China into Muslim regions in the 8th
century, then to Spain (and then the rest of Europe) in the 10th
century. Paper was easier to manufacture than parchment and less likely
to crack than papyrus and could absorb ink, making it difficult to erase
and ideal for keeping records. Islamic paper makers devised
assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions
far larger than any available in Europe for centuries. The best-known
fiction from the Islamic world is *The Book of One Thousand and One
Nights*, which took form in the 10th century and reached its final form
by the 14th century, although the number and type of tales vary.

Ibn Rushd, also known by his Latinized name Averroës (April 14,
1126--December 10, 1198), was an Al-Andalus Muslim polymath, a master of
Aristotelian philosophy, Islamic philosophy, Islamic theology, Maliki
law and jurisprudence, logic, psychology, politics, Andalusian classical
music theory, medicine, astronomy, geography, mathematics, physics, and
celestial mechanics. Averroes was born in Córdoba, Al-Andalus,
present-day Spain, and died in Marrakesh, present-day Morocco.

The 13th-century philosophical movement based on Averroes' work is
called Averroism. Both Ibn Rushd and the scholar Ibn Sina played a major
role in saving the works of Aristotle, whose ideas came to dominate the
non-religious thought of the Christian and Muslim worlds. Ibn Rushd has
been described as the "founding father of secular thought in Western
Europe." He tried to reconcile Aristotle's system of thought with Islam.
According to him, there is no conflict between religion and philosophy;
rather, they are different ways of reaching the same truth. He believed
in the eternity of the universe. Ibn Ruhd also held that the soul is
divided into two parts, one individual and one divine; while the
individual soul is not eternal, all humans at the basic level share one
and the same divine soul.

### 8.8.2 Science, Mathematics, and Medicine {.import-Header3}

The Arabs assimilated the scientific knowledge of the civilizations they
had conquered, including the ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese,
Indian, Egyptian, and Phoenician civilizations. Scientists recovered the
Alexandrian mathematical, geometric, and astronomical knowledge, such as
that of Euclid and Claudius Ptolemy.

Persian scientist Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī significantly developed
algebra in his landmark text *Kitab al-Jabr* *wa-l-Muqabala*, from which
the term "algebra" is derived. The term "algorithm" is derived from the
name of the scholar al-Khwarizmi, who was also responsible for
introducing the Arabic numerals and Hindu-Arabic numeral system beyond
the Indian subcontinent. In calculus, the scholar Alhazen discovered the
sum formula for the fourth power, using a method readily generalizable
to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the
volume of a paraboloid.

Medicine was a central part of medieval Islamic culture. Responding to
circumstances of time and place, Islamic physicians and scholars
developed a large and complex medical literature exploring and
synthesizing the theory and practice of medicine. Islamic medicine was
built on tradition, chiefly the theoretical and practical knowledge
developed in India, Greece, Persia, and Rome. Islamic scholars
translated their writings from Syriac, Greek, and Sanskrit into Arabic
and then produced new medical knowledge based on those texts. In order
to make the Greek tradition more accessible, understandable, and
teachable, Islamic scholars organized the Greco-Roman medical knowledge
into encyclopedias.

### 8.8.2 Art {.import-Header3}

Ceramics, glass, metalwork, textiles, illuminated manuscripts, and
woodwork flourished during the Islamic Golden Age. Manuscript
illumination became an important and greatly respected art, and portrait
miniature painting flourished in Persia. Calligraphy, an essential
aspect of written Arabic, developed in manuscripts and architectural
decoration.

Typically, though not entirely, Islamic art depicts nature patterns and
Arabic calligraphy, rather than figures, because many Muslims feared
that the depiction of the human form is idolatry and thereby a sin
against God, forbidden in the Quran. There are repeating elements in
Islamic art, such as the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in
a repetition known as the arabesque. The arabesque in Islamic art is
often used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible, and infinite
nature of God. Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced
as a show of humility by artists who believe only God can produce
perfection, although this theory is disputed.

The traditional instrument of the Arabic calligrapher is the qalam, a
pen made of dried reed or bamboo. Qalam ink is often in color and chosen
such that its intensity can vary greatly, so that the greater strokes of
the compositions can be very dynamic in their effect. Islamic
calligraphy is applied on a wide range of decorative mediums other than
paper, such as tiles, vessels, carpets, and inscriptions. Before the
advent of paper, papyrus and parchment were used for writing.

By the 10th century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began
weaving inscriptions on elaborately patterned silks. These
calligraphic-inscribed textiles were so precious that Crusaders brought
them to Europe as prized possessions. A notable example is the Suaire de
Saint-Josse, used to wrap the bones of St. Josse in the abbey of St.
Josse-sur-Mer near Caen in northwestern France.

There were many advances in architectural construction, and mosques,
tombs, palaces, and forts were inspired by Persian and Byzantine
architecture. Islamic mosaic art anticipated principles of
quasicrystalline geometry, which would not be discovered for 500 more
years. This art used symmetric polygonal shapes to create patterns that
can continue indefinitely without repeating. These patterns have even
helped modern scientists understand quasicrystals at the atomic levels.

## 8.11 THE LATER EMPIRES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

### 8.11.1 The Abbasid Empire (c. 750 CE) {.import-Header3}

The Abbasid Caliphate was the third of the Islamic caliphates to succeed
the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 750 CE and ruled over a large,
flourishing empire for three centuries. The Umayyad dynasty was
overthrown by another family of Meccan origin, the Abbasids, in 750 CE.
The Abbasids distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking
their moral character and administration. In particular, they appealed
to non-Arab Muslims, known as mawali, who remained outside the
kinship-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class
within the Umayyad empire. The Abbasid dynasty descended from Muhammad's
youngest uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib (566--653 CE), from whom the
dynasty takes its name. Muhammad ibn 'Ali, a great-grandson of Abbas,
began to campaign for the return of power to the family of Muhammad, the
Hashemites, in Persia during the reign of Umar II, an Umayyad caliph who
ruled from 717 to 720 CE.

The Abbasids moved the empire's capital from Damascus, in modern-day
Syria, to Baghdad, in modern-day Iraq, in 762 CE. The Abbasids had
depended heavily on the support of Persians in their overthrow of the
Umayyads, and the geographic power shift appeased the Persian mawali
support base. Abu al-'Abbas's successor, Al-Mansur, welcomed non-Arab
Muslims to his court. While this helped integrate Arab and Persian
cultures, it alienated the Arabs who had supported the Abbasids in their
battles against the Umayyads. The Abbasids established the new position
of vizier to delegate central authority and delegated even greater
authority to local emirs. As the viziers exerted greater influence, many
Abbasid caliphs were relegated to a more ceremonial role as Persian
bureaucracy slowly replaced the old Arab aristocracy.

The Abbasids, who ruled from Baghdad, had an unbroken line of caliphs
for over three centuries, consolidating Islamic rule and cultivating
great intellectual and cultural developments in the Middle East in the
Golden Age of Islam. By 940 CE, however, the power of the caliphate
under the Abbasids began waning as non-Arabs gained influence and the
various subordinate sultans and emirs became increasingly independent.

</figure>

The Abbasid leadership worked to overcome the political challenges of a
large empire with limited communication in the last half of the 8th
century (750--800 CE). While the Byzantine Empire was fighting Abbasid
rule in Syria and Anatolia, the caliphate's military operations were
focused on internal unrest. Local governors had begun to exert greater
autonomy, using their increasing power to make their positions
hereditary. Simultaneously, former supporters of the Abbasids had broken
away to create a separate kingdom around Khorasan in northern Persia.

Several factions left the empire to exercise independent authority. In
793 CE, the Shi'a (also called Shi'ite) dynasty of Idrisids gained
authored over Fez in Morocco. The Berber Kharijites set up an
independent state in North Africa in 801 CE. A family of governors under
the Abbasids became increasingly independent until they founded the
Aghlabid Emirate in the 830s. Within 50 years, the Idrisids in the
Maghreb, the Aghlabids of Ifriqiya, and the Tulunids and Ikshidids of
Misr became independent in Africa.

By the 860s, governors in Egypt set up their own Tulunid Emirate, so
named for its founder Ahmad ibn Tulun, starting a dynastic rule separate
from the caliph. In the eastern territories, local governors decreased
their ties to the central Abbasid rule. The Saffarids of Herat and the
Samanids of Bukhara seceded in the 870s to cultivate a more Persian
culture and rule. The Tulunid dynasty managed Palestine, the Hijaz, and
parts of Egypt. By 900 CE, the Abbasids controlled only central
Mesopotamia, and the Byzantine Empire began to reconquer western
Anatolia.

### 8.11.2 The Fatimid Caliphate (909--1171 CE) {.import-Header3}

Several factions challenged the Abbasids' claims to the caliphate. Most
Shi'a Muslims had supported the Abbasid war against the Umayyads because
the Abbasids claimed legitimacy with their familial connection to
Muhammad, an important issue for Shi'a. However, once in power, the
Abbasids embraced Sunni Islam and disavowed any support for Shi'a
beliefs.

The Shiʻa Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty, who
claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, declared himself Caliph in 909
CE and created a separate line of caliphs in North Africa. The Fatimid
caliphs initially controlled Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, and
they expanded for the next 150 years, taking Egypt and Palestine. The
Abbasid dynasty finally challenged Fatimid rule, limiting them to Egypt.
By the 920s, a Shi'a sect that only recognized the first five Imams and
could trace its roots to Muhammad's daughter Fatima took control of
Idrisi and then Aghlabid domains. This group advanced to Egypt in 969
CE, establishing their capital near Fustat in Cairo, which they built as
a bastion of Shi'a learning and politics. By 1000 CE, they had become
the chief political and ideological challenge to Abbasid Sunni Islam. At
this point, the Abbasid dynasty had fragmented into several
governorships that were mostly autonomous, although they official
recognized caliphal authority from Baghdad. The caliph himself was under
"protection" of the Buyid Emirs, who possessed all of Iraq and western
Iran and were quietly Shi'a in their sympathies.

Outside Iraq, all the autonomous provinces slowly became states with
hereditary rulers, armies, and revenues. They operated under only
nominal caliph authority, with emirs ruling their own provinces from
their own capitals. Mahmud of Ghazni took the title of "sultan," instead
of "emir," signifying the Ghaznavid Empire's independence from caliphal
authority, despite Mahmud's ostentatious displays of Sunni orthodoxy and
ritual submission to the caliph. In the 11th century, the loss of
respect for the caliphs continued, as some Islamic rulers no longer
mentioned the caliph's name in the Friday khutba or struck it off their
coinage. The political power of the Abbasids largely ended with the rise
of the Buyids and the Seljuq Turks in 1258 CE. Though lacking in
political power, the dynasty continued to claim authority in religious
matters until after the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517.

They also founded the new city of Cairo, rather than contend with older,
possibly rebellious cities like Alexandria. Cairo developed into the
preeminent cultural and economic center of the Islamic world, taking
over from a Baghdad in decline.

## 8.12 THE CRUSADES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In 1095, Urban II launched the first crusade from Clermont, a city in
southern France. He had benefited from recent church reforms, renewed
religious fervor, and a concomitant increase in papal power. While
traveling through France, he made an argument for the recovery of the
Holy Land: because it belonged to Jesus, it should be controlled by his
followers. He also appealed to the greatness of the Franks, promising
potential pilgrims a land flowing with milk, honey, and riches. And he
offered them well-designed spiritual rewards. For example, salvation
applied to those who died on campaign, and anyone who invested in a
crusade secured themselves a place in heaven.

The Crusades started in 1096 and were part of a larger process whereby
Muslims ceded territory to non-Muslims, sometimes permanently. Provoked
by al-Hakim's treatment of Christians in the Holy Land, as well as the
Turkic invasion of Anatolia, Europeans commenced several centuries'
worth of armed crusades against the Muslim states of the eastern
Mediterranean and North Africa. Save for the first crusade, in which the
Christians established the Crusader states of Edessa, Antioch, Tripoli,
and the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, all of their campaigns ended in
disaster. In fact, they were either looting expeditions or responses to
the loss of Crusader states to Muslims. The success that the Latin
knights did enjoy related to not only the political fragmentation of the
Seljuqs in the eastern Mediterranean but also the general disinterest of
the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt, which had been dealing with both the
repercussions of a religious schism and the consequences of famine and
plague. Slow to respond to the challenge posed by the Christians, the
Fatimids watched the Crusaders from afar with indifference.

The Muslim counterattack eventually came under the direction of **Salah
al-Din** (Saladin) (d. 1193), a unifier of various Muslim factions in
the eastern Mediterranean. An ethnic Kurd, he hailed from a family of
soldiers of fortune in the employ of the Zengid Dynasty's Nur al-Din, a
vassal of the Seljuq Turks. Salah al-Din set off in his twenties to
fight battles for his uncle, Shirkuh, a Zengid general. A dynamic leader
and tactician, he helped his uncle dispatch with the Fatimid opposition
in Egypt and solidified Nur al-Din's rule there. His uncle dying soon
thereafter, Salah al-Din eventually became the vizier, or senior
minister, to Nur al-Din in 1169. For five years, Salah al-Din ruled
Egypt on behalf of Nur al-Din. Then Nur al-Din died in Damascus in 1174,
leaving no clear successor.

### 8.12.1 The Ayyubid Sultanate {.import-Header3}

In the absence of a formal heir to Nur al-Din, Salah al-Din established
the Ayyubid Dynasty (1171--1260), named after his father, Ayyub, a
provincial governor for the Zengid Dynasty, a family of Oghuz Turks who
served as vassals of the Seljuq Empire. Once in power, Salah al-Din
established a Sunni government and insisted that the mosque of al-Azhar
preach his brand of Islam. He used the concept of *jihad* to unify the
Middle East under the banner of Islam in order to defeat the Christians,
but he did not principally direct *jihad* towards them. A champion of
Sunni Islam, he believed that his religion was being threatened mainly
from within by the Shi'a. Like most of their predecessors, the Ayyubids
also benefited from tribal *'asabiyah*, or dynastic consensus. Ayyubid
'asabiyah included a Kurdish heritage, as well as a strong desire to
return to Sunni orthodoxy. It was as champions of Sunni Islam that they
purposely recruited leading Muslim scholars from abroad, ultimately
culminating in Egypt becoming the preeminent state in the Islamic world.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 617px">

</figure>

Initially, Salah al-Din displayed no particular interest in the Crusader
states. He had clashed with the Crusaders and King Baldwin IV of
Jerusalem; also, Raynald de Chântillon even had handed him a rare defeat
at the Battle of Montgisard in 1177. But the Crusaders ultimately
brokered an armistice with Salah al-Din. Eventually, Raynald broke their
truce when he started attacking Muslim pilgrims and trade caravans in
the 1180s. Ensuing skirmishes between the forces of Salah al-Din and Guy
de Lusignan, the new King of Jerusalem, presaged a forthcoming battle.
In 1187, the two sides met near Tiberias, in modern-day Israel. Salah
al-Din intentionally attacked the fortress of Tiberius in order to lure
the Crusaders away from their well-watered stronghold. His plan worked,
and the Christians quickly ran out of water. On the night before the
battle, Salah al-Din set brush fires to exacerbate their thirst. He
coerced the parched Latin knights down through the Horns of Hattin
towards the cool waters of Lake Tiberius. Salah al-Din bottlenecked the
Crusader forces, with the double hill of Hattin acting as a choke point.

**The Battle of Hattin** represented a smashing victory for Salah al-Din
and a major loss for the Crusaders. Tradition dictated that Salah al-Din
hold most of the leaders for ransom. Unlike the Crusaders, he treated
the defenders of cities with understanding. He showed tolerance of
minorities and even established a committee to partition Jerusalem
amongst all the interested religious groups. In this way, he proved his
moral superiority to the Crusaders.

With most of their important leaders either killed in battle or
captured, no unified Christian leadership remained to fight against
Salah al-Din. Deprived of the backbone of their organization, the
Crusaders were left with only a few defenseless fortresses along the
coast. Salah al-Din pressed his advantage. Increasingly isolated and
relying on ever dwindling numbers of Latin Christians willing to remain
permanently in the Holy Land, the Latin Crusaders were eventually
expelled from the region in 1291.

Although Salah al-Din had maintained direct control over Egypt, he
intentionally distributed control over wide swaths of the empire to
loyal vassals and family members, whose governance became increasingly
autonomous from Cairo. Salah al-Din's sons and grandsons, who did not
have the same ability as their forefather, had trouble managing an
increasingly decentralized empire. Widespread *mamluk* factionalism and
family disputes over the control of territory contributed to the
weakening of the sultanate.

In this vacuum of power, the *mamluks,* a former Turkish slave caste of
Egypt, came to the fore.

## 8.13 THE MAMLUK SULTANATE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The year was 1249, and Louis IX's seventh crusade had just gotten
underway when as-Salih, the last Ayyubid ruler, took to his deathbed.
Under the eminent threat of a Crusader invasion, **Shajar** **al-Durr**,
a Turkish concubine, agreed to take over the reins of government until
her son, Turanshah, could assert himself. While *mamluks* did not
possess a tribal *'asabiyah* in the traditional sense, they did
constitute a proud caste of elite warriors who had an exaggerated sense
of group solidarity. As a social group, their former status as slaves
provided them with enough group cohesion to overthrow the Ayyubids.

Shajar al-Durr saw herself as another Cleopatra and wanted to rule in
her own right. In 1257, in an effort to avoid a power struggle, Shajar
al-Durr had her husband, Aybak, strangled and claimed that he had died a
natural death. Not long thereafter, Aybak's fifteen year old son,
al-Mansur 'Ali, had Shajar al-Durr stripped and beaten to death. He
reigned as sultan for two years until Qutuz, a leading *mamluk*, deposed
him, as he thought the sultanate needed a strong and capable ruler to
deal with the looming Mongol threat.

The Mamluk Sultanate appeared to be on a collision course with Hulagu's
Ilkhanate, one of Mongol Empire's four khanates, whose forces were
advancing through the Mamluk-held Levant. Then in the summer of 1260,
the Great Khan Möngke died, and Hulagu returned home with the bulk of
his forces to participate in the required khuriltai, or Mongol assembly,
perhaps expecting to be elected the next Great Khan. Hulagu left his
general Kitbuqa behind with a smaller army to fight the Mamluks. In July
of that year, a confrontation took place at **Ayn** **Jalut**, near Lake
Tiberias. During the ensuing battle, the Mamluk General Baybars drew out
the Mongols with a feigned retreat. Hiding behind a hill, Aybak's
*mamluk* heavy cavalrymen ambushed the unsuspecting Mongols and defeated
them in close combat, securing a rare victory over the Mongols. The
Mamluks captured and executed Kitbuqa and forced the remnants of the
Mongol forces to retreat. Just days after their signal victory over the
Mongols, **Baybars** (1260--1277) murdered Qutuz, continuing a pattern
of rule in which only the strongest Mamluk rulers could survive. The
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries witnessed the decline of the Mamluk
Empire. Several internal and external factors help explain their
decline. Domestically, the Black Death ravaged Egypt for years. In fact,
it continued in North Africa longer than it did in Europe. This plague
caused economic disruption in the sultanate. With fewer people
available, labor, or human capital, became much more expensive. Further,
plague-related inflation destabilized the economy, as the value of goods
and services also rose. The *mamluks* responded to inflationary
pressures by increasing taxes, but their revenue from those taxes
actually decreased. This decrease made it difficult for the *mamluks* to
maintain their irrigation networks, and without irrigation, agricultural
productivity decreased.

Externally, plague was not the only cause of inflation. Columbus's
discovery of the New World began a process in which gold began filtering
through Europe and into North Africa. Egypt's weak economy could not
absorb this massive influx of money, thus causing more inflation. New
trade routes, like the one pioneered by Vasco de Gama, offered Europeans
direct sea routes to Asia. No longer was Egypt the middleman for
long-distance trade between Europe and Asia, thereby losing out on
valuable revenue from tariffs. The profits from commerce transferred to
the ascending states of Portugal and Spain. With the defeat of the
Mamluks in the Ottoman--Mamluk War of 1516--1517, the stage was set for
the rise of the Ottomans.

## 8.14 CONCLUSION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

A contemporary historian who served the Mamluk Sultanate, Ibn Khaldun
astutely recognized the applicability of his Cyclical Theory of History
to the evolution of Islamic history during the period covered in this
chapter. By the eighth century, Islam became the predominant social and
political unifier of the Middle East. And for the next nine hundred
years, various caliphates used family and religion as tools to rule the
region. However, these caliphates faced religiously-inspired revolts
that challenged their authority. Quelling these revolts weakened the
regimes, often leading to greater decentralization and the fragmentation
of empires. Into these vacuums of power, new families armed with tribal
'*asabiyah* and a novel religious ideology came forth to supplant a once
dominant group who had succumbed to the wiles of civilization and whose
influence gradually waned in the face of insurgent desert peoples.

## 9.2 INTRODUCTION

Adventurously sailing the Indian Ocean in the early 1500s CE, Duarte
Barbosa, a Portuguese naval officer, was confident that he was helping
to forge a new, enduring era of Portuguese dominance. As he passed
through several Swahili (syncretism of Bantu and Arabic) city-states on
the East African coast, Barbosa noted the brisk trade and the riches of
these African settlements where he saw a "great plenty of gold" that
would serve Portuguese
interests[^\[1\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-1 "Quoted in “The East Coast of Africa: Duarte Barbosa,” Aspects of World Civilization, vol. 1, Ed. Perry M. Rogers, (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003): 376."){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"}. In his mind, God had destined these
stashes of gold for the Portuguese, and the local Swahili rulers acted
unwisely and arrogantly to defend themselves. In the conflict that
followed, the Portuguese plundered the Swahili city-states, burning
buildings and enslaving African men and women. Barbosa boasted that when
the Portuguese looted the settlements, they slaughtered many people and
took a "great spoil of gold and silver and
goods."[^\[2\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-2 "Ibid, p. 377."){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"} Barbosa's description highlights the
violence of Portuguese conquest and also his expectation that he and his
countrymen were creating a new Portuguese empire that would make a
lasting mark in East Africa and the wider Indian Ocean World. However,
less than 100 years later, Portuguese influences were noticeably absent
in most of East Africa, and their power in the Indian Ocean was fading
rapidly. Barbosa himself had traveled with his brother-in-law, Ferdinand
Magellan, and met an untimely end in the Philippines, killed at a
banquet days after Magellan himself was poisoned in a battle against
local opponents. Writing about the coast of East Africa, Barbosa paid
little heed to the hundreds of years of Swahili history that preceded
his visit. Therefore, his narrative gives us minimal information about
Swahili civilization. This chapter will fill in some of the silences in
the written historical record as it describes Africa's major
contributions to world history.

Americans have many common misconceptions about Africa reinforced by
contemporary news stories that focus on drought, famine, and war. In
addition to associating Africa with extreme hardships, a plethora of
western-made TV shows focus on wildlife and the rainforests. However,
these popular images do not give an accurate portrayal of the everyday
experiences of most Africans or tell us much about the history of the
continent.

One of the main points glossed over by these popular images is that the
African continent is large and diverse. Africa is the second largest
continent in the world. Today, it has over 50 independent countries. You
can also find just about every imaginable environment---from savannahs,
rainforests, and deserts to glaciers and snow-capped mountains---in
Africa. Its over 1,000 languages (or about one-third of the world's
languages) also demonstrate the continent's
diversity.[^\[3\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-3 "African Language Program, Department of African and African American Studies, “African Languages,” Harvard University, http://aaas.fas.harvard.edu/greetings-director-african-language-program."){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-3
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 3"} Africa is home to more than a billion
people, who are living, working, and raising their families.

Historically, Africans faced significant environmental challenges that
limited population growth. There are exceptions, but overall, African
soils are poor, and rainfall has been unpredictable. The more temperate
climates in a number of regions slow the decomposition of organic
materials in the soil, meaning that the soil in many regions has few
minerals and nutrients. The areas that are exceptions, such as the
highlands of Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Burundi, have seen much higher
population concentrations. Rainfall also tends to be concentrated in
just two or three months a year, while disease has been yet another
challenge.

Considering the past 5,000 years of African history, malaria, yellow
fever, and trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness) have made
the biggest impacts on population growth and settlement patterns. Even
today, all three diseases affect the continent. Both **malaria** and
**yellow fever** are spread to people by mosquitos. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), despite preventative measures and great
efforts to extend the availability of treatments, malaria was
responsible for almost 600,000 deaths in 2013. Children in Africa
account for most of the fatalities, and the WHO estimates that currently
one African child dies from malaria every minute of every day. It causes
symptoms like headaches, fever, and chills. Even though it does not
usually constitute a medical emergency for adults, malaria does decrease
productivity and has significant treatment costs. On the other hand,
yellow fever has a high mortality rate---about 50%---even amongst
healthy adult
populations.[^\[4\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-4 "World Health Organization Media Centre, “Yellow Fever: Fact Sheet,” http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs100/en"){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-4
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 4"} While malaria and yellow fever have
historically taken the largest toll on human populations, one of the
main effects of **trypanosomiasis** (or sleeping sickness) has been to
limit the practicality of keeping certain types of livestock in Africa.
Horses and many breeds of cattle, in addition to humans, are especially
susceptible to trypanosomiasis. The disease is spread by the tsetse fly
and can lead [either]{style="font-size: 1em;"} to chronic
illness---characterized by weight loss, fever, anemia, cardiac lesions,
and other symptoms---or to a more immediate death. Until the past fifty
years or so, in many parts of the continent, these noteworthy challenges
with disease, alongside the low fertility of the soils and the
unpredictable rainfalls, were significant constraints on human
population growth. Environmental challenges and disease also affected
settlement patterns as, for example, people avoided more forested and
wetter areas because of the prevalence of mosquitoes. Additionally,
Africans continuously adapted their herding and farming techniques to
overcome these challenges.

## 9.5 WRITING THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL AFRICA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Scholars of Africa, particularly those working in the last two
generations, have employed all sorts of methods to describe the ancient
African past. They have necessarily been on the forefront of
methodological innovation because of the limited availability of written
primary sources, meaning sources recorded by ancient Africans
themselves. Therefore, scholars have turned to a wide range of materials
to complement the available written records.

Before about 1800 CE, many African societies kept their records orally,
as opposed to in written form. These societies have rich, complex
histories that some past historians, relying primarily on written
records, ignored when they studied the African continent.

European and American views of Africans during the nineteenth century
were generally derogatory and prejudiced. Alongside these views,
professional scholars tended to portray Africans as primitive, meaning
unchanged from time immemorial. Western methodologies, with their
reliance on written sources, backed up European views of Africans as
unchanged. Two general results of the nineteenth-century scholarship in
the West were the assumptions that Africa, which was commonly referred
to as "the dark continent," lacked a history prior to European arrival
on the continent and that any urban developments or complex state
structures in Africa were the achievements of outsiders. For example, as
you will see in this chapter, there were nineteenth-century European
scholars who credited people from Yemen with building the Axum trading
empire and attributed the archaeological findings at Great Zimbabwe to
Phoenicians. Especially since the 1960s, there has been a strong
movement to reclaim these (and other) developments as African. As part
of this effort, scholars employ new methodologies, including the study
of oral sources, archaeology, climate change, linguistics (the study of
languages), and paleoarchaobotany (the study of ancient plant
materials), to gain more accurate, multi-faceted information about the
African past.

Perhaps most contested and also potentially the most revealing are the
available oral sources. Many ancient African societies had people with
training in oral histories and preserving traditions. For example,
**griots** in parts of West Africa memorized chronologies, cultural
traditions, and legal precedence to advise kings and state leaders.
Griots also traveled and performed theater and praise-songs throughout
the empire to spread cultural values and communicate news from the
government. Griots held honored places in their societies, reflecting
their importance to both rulers and people's everyday lives. They passed
on locally produced proverbs and oral teaching. Additionally, African
communities honored older generations for their knowledge of the past,
leading Amadou Hampate Ba, a famous author from Mali, to write, "In
Africa, when an old man dies, it's a library burning," since he takes
with him so many oral
histories.[^\[5\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-5 "Quoted in Ann Badkhen, Walking with Abel: Journeys with the Nomads of the African Savannah (New York: Riverhead Books, 2015): 20."){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-5
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 5"} Using oral sources is not without its
challenges, however, but their inclusion has broadened the scholarly
understanding of African societies.

### 9.5.1 Terminology {.import-Header3}

Especially due to nineteenth-century tendencies to portray Africans as
inferior, current scholars of Africa have a whole host of stereotypes to
correct. One of the main stereotypes they encounter is the common
perception that African societies are timeless, that they have not
changed in hundreds or thousands of years. The movie *The Gods Must Be
Crazy* encapsulates this stereotype. *The Gods Must Be Crazy* (1980) is
a fictional account that follows the San people in the Kalahari Desert
in southern Africa. The movie portrays the San as untouched by and
unaware of the modern world until one member of their community finds a
Coke bottle discarded from an airplane. In the movie, adventure ensues.

Movies, television shows, and other media often show us an Africa that
is rural, a landscape dominated by wild animals, and a continent
isolated from the rest of the modern world. However, these images do not
accurately represent the continent in either our present time or the
past. In 2010, one-third of Africa's population lived in cities, and it
is likely that one-half of Africa's population will be urban dwelling by
2030.[^\[6\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-6 "“Growth Areas: the urbanisation of Africa,” Economist (Dec. 13, 2010),"){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-6
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 6"} Lagos (Nigeria) is Africa's largest
city south of the Sahara Desert, with population experts estimating that
it is home to 21 million people. With this estimate, Lagos is on par
size-wise with cities like Beijing, Cairo, and Mexico City. Urbanization
on this scale is a fairly recent phenomenon. However, this chapter will
introduce you to some Medieval cities, including the famous city of
Timbuktu, to discuss African urban cultures. We will also explore the
trade routes that connected Africa to much of the world, emphasizing
that Africa has been connected to the Arabian Peninsula, Asia, and
Europe for millennia.

Even if we do not intend it to, some of the language that we use on an
everyday basis can perpetuate assumptions that Africa is isolated or
behind the rest of the world. One example of a potentially problematic
term is "**tribe**." As African historian Christopher Ehret has pointed
out, the use of "tribe" in reference to Africans often carries the
underlying judgement that the people who are "tribal" are exotic, wild,
backwards, and potentially dangerous. In common usage, "tribesmen" are
not modern citizens of nation-states but instead remnants of the past.
To highlight the discriminatory use of the term, Ehret asks us to
consider why African wars are often referred to as "tribal" wars instead
of as the civil wars they actually are, and,

> ...Why is Shaka, the famous nineteenth-century ruler, called the king
> of the Zulu "tribe" when he was actually the king of a centralized and
> military powerful state? Why are Africans in "traditional" dress said
> to be engaging in "tribal" dancing, when Europeans garbed similarly in
> the clothes of an earlier time are said to be performing "folk"

Instead, it is better to discuss much more fluid, adaptive, or inclusive
ethnic identities in Africa. Arguably, nineteenth-century Europeans
tried to harden divisions and create "tribes" to suit their own
administrative purposes. Dismissing Africans as "tribal" also allowed
European to legitimize the trans-Atlantic slave trade (in the fifteenth
through nineteenth centuries) and colonization of the continent (in the
nineteenth century). Today, people often fall back on "tribe" and
"tribal" instead of trying to understand the complexities of African
politics and social organization.

There are a handful of other terms that modern scholars scrutinize to
show that they are based on similar prejudices. Two such terms are
"stateless society" and "bushmen." Many written sources from the
nineteenth century produced by Europeans did not recognize the existence
of states in Africa that had more democratic, less centralized, or less
hierarchical leadership structures. These written sources assumed that
all states had kings or other centralized authority figures. Some
African societies were centralized under the rule of monarchs, but
others used, for example, councils of elders; had more decentralized,
egalitarian systems; or relied on age-sets to mobilize labor and manage
government affairs. These latter examples had functioning governmental
structures, but nineteenth-century Europeans usually did not recognize
these alternative forms of state organization and claimed that Africans
were incapable of ruling themselves without European intervention. The
use of the phrase "stateless society" was one way that Europeans claimed
to be more advanced and thus destined to colonize Africa in the
nineteenth century.

If we understand how words like "tribe" and "stateless society" have
been used in the past, then we can avoid perpetuating some of the
problematic stereotypes about Africa. Overall, as you read this chapter,
keep in mind that Africa has been a continent of innovation and change
since the first behaviorally modern humans emerged there between 200,000
and 100,000 years ago. Africans were some of the first farmers and some
of the first iron-workers. Africans developed their own artistic
traditions (see Figure 9.2, Map 9.3, Figure 9.3) and unique state
structures. With such a big, diverse continent to consider, this chapter
examines four civilizations (states of larger scale and complexity) to
show major changes occurring across the continent. Each of these states
was also connected to the rest of the world. The chapter starts with
ancient Ethiopia in Northeast Africa (300 to 700 CE) and moves to the
Western Sudanic Empires in the Sahel of West Africa (800 to 1591 CE). In
the second half, it discusses Great Zimbabwe (1200 to 1450 CE) and,
finally, the Swahili states in East Africa (1000 to 1500 CE).

## 9.6 AKSUM AND ETHIOPIA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

**Aksum**, which was at its most powerful in the fourth through sixth
centuries CE, was located in what are today Ethiopia, Eritrea, and parts
of Sudan. At its high point, Aksum extended its influence beyond Africa
into parts of the southern Arabian Peninsula. It was a great trading
empire, with its own coinage, its own language, and its own distinctive
Christian church. If you are familiar with accounts of the Queen of
Sheba, you know pieces of the story that Ethiopians use to explain the
origins of the Ethiopian Solomonic Dynasty and their possession of the
Ark of the Covenant. The capital of the kingdom was the city of Aksum,
and its most important port was Adulis. The kingdom stretched into the
Sudan and Yemen at its height in the sixth century.

Unlike some other regions in Africa, Ethiopia had very fertile, volcanic
soils that supported large populations. Climatic variation found at the
different elevations throughout Ethiopia also encouraged agricultural
diversification and trade. Around 7000 BCE, there was population growth
in the region that corresponded with the Agricultural Revolution. While
some domesticated animals and crops were introduced from Northeast
Africa and the Fertile Crescent, Ethiopians domesticated other crops
themselves. Most notably, Ethiopians domesticated teff, a grass, and
nsete, known as the "false banana," that they ground to make bread and
porridge. We also have Ethiopians to thank for coffee! Since the
Neolithic Revolution, Ethiopia stands out for its agricultural
productivity and innovation, both of which sustained large populations
in the region.

The ***Kebra*** ***Nagast*** ("The Glory of Kings"), a 700-year-old text
that is sacred for Ethiopian Christians and Rastafarians, traces the
origins of the Ethiopian royal family back to the Queen of Sheba and
King Solomon of Jerusalem. The *Kebra* *Nagast* identifies the Queen of
Sheba as an Ethiopian ruler known locally as **Queen** **Mekeda**.
According to the text, in approximately 950 BCE, the newly enthroned
Queen Mekeda traveled to study with Jerusalem's well-known king, King
Solomon. Queen Mekeda wanted a capable mentor for leadership advice and
spiritual guidance. Charmed by her, King Solomon played these roles and
Queen Mekeda, flattered by his attentions, was hardworking and devoted,
and eventually converted to Judaism. As their lessons continued, King
Solomon planned the seduction of Queen Mekeda, which, as described in
the text, occurred when Solomon tricked and cornered her. Their sexual
union produced a child, Menelik I, to whom Queen Mekeda gave birth on
her journey home to Ethiopia.

</figure>

As time passed, King Solomon remained haunted by a dream that Menelik
was his rightful successor and was delighted when his son, as an adult,
returned to Jerusalem. According to the *Kebra* *Nagast,* King Solomon
intended for Menelik to follow him as the next king of Jerusalem, but
Menelik refused and instead returned to Ethiopia. In an unexpected
twist, when leaving Jerusalem, part of Menelik's entourage stole the Ark
of the Covenant, which held the Ten Commandments. When King Solomon
discovered the theft, he sent soldiers to recapture the Ark of the
Covenant. However, according to the *Kebra* *Nagast*, God helped Menelik
and his men evade capture by lifting them up over the Red Sea. In the
end, Menelik and the Ark of the Covenant made it safely to Ethiopia. For
Ethiopian Christians, the *Kebra* *Nagast* partially explains the
formation of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (the Tawahedo Church).
Through today, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims possession of the
Ark of the Covenant, which it says is housed in the Church of Our Lady
Mary of Zion in Aksum, Ethiopia.

According to the *Kebra* *Nagast*, early Ethiopian rulers were
descendants of King Solomon through Menelik I. More than two thousand
years after King Solomon's rule, a thirteenth century Ethiopian king,
Yekuno Amlak (r. 1270--1285 CE), reclaimed this legacy by tracing his
origins back to King Solomon and Queen Mekeda. He founded what became
known as the Solomonic Dynasty, which ruled Ethiopia for about 500 years
from 1270 to 1769 CE. Members of Ethiopia's royal family continued to
claim descent from King Solomon up through the last Ethiopian emperor,
Haile Selassie, who was overthrown in 1974. Therefore, the link back to
King Solomon and Queen Mekeda is part of Ethiopian religious beliefs and
has also legitimized claims to political power.

</figure>

From the era of the rule of Queen Mekeda in about the tenth century BCE
and Yekuno Amlak's revival of the Solomonic Dynasty in the thirteenth
century CE, the largest kingdoms in Ethiopia were Da'amat and Aksum. The
**Kingdom of** **Da'amat** was the first to emerge in northern Ethiopia
in about the tenth century BCE. Archeological finds show that, by the
seventh century BCE, ivory, tortoiseshell, rhino horn, gold, silver, and
slaves were brought from interior regions of Africa and traded through
Da'amat for imported cloth, tools, metals, and jewelry. Inscriptions,
imagery, architectural styles, and even overlaps in historical
traditions (such as those associated with the Queen of Sheba) also
suggest close connections between the Kingdom of Da'amat and Saba
(Yemen) in Southern Arabia. For example, the Kingdom of Da'amat used
religious symbols in its monumental architecture, including the disc and
crescent, also found in Southern Arabia. The oldest standing building in
Ethiopia, the Temple at Yeha (c. 700 BCE), had an altar with these
symbols. Up until several decades ago, some scholars used evidence of
these connections to argue that people from Saba founded the
civilization at Da'amat. Now, in line with the trend to reclaim African
civilizations, very vocal scholars push us to acknowledge the African
origins of the Kingdom of Da'amat and view it as a precursor to the
trading empire of Aksum.

</figure>

The Kingdom of Da'amat weakened in the fourth century BCE as Red Sea
trade became more important than some of the previous northern overland
routes. It gave way to the state of Aksum, with its important cities of
Adulis and Aksum. Adulis, positioned on the coast, rose in prominence
and grew wealthy. It served as a safe harbor for ships traveling from
Southeast Asia. The growing capital city in the interior, Aksum, was a
stopover point for land-based trade routes into the Sudan and especially
Sub-Saharan Africa. Ivory, slaves, tools, spices, gold, silver jewelry,
copper, and iron were eventually traded through the capital city of
Aksum to the coast. The state of Aksum began minting its own gold and
silver coins in the third century CE, demonstrating how important
long-distance trade was to its economy.

In addition to its role in inter-regional trade, Aksum was also known
for its early conversion to Christianity. Ethiopian tradition traces the
establishment of Christianity in the region back to two shipwrecked
Syrians. One of the Syrians, Frumentius, was particularly influential
because he became the first bishop of Ethiopia in 303 CE and guided the
king of Aksum, **King** **Ezana** (r. 325--350 CE), in his conversion to
Christianity. Some of the coins minted in Aksum actually attest to King
Ezana's conversion, as the coins from the first half of Ezana's reign
have the disc and crescent symbols of earlier Ethiopian rulers, while
coins from the later decades of Ezana's reign have a Christian cross. As
bishop, Frumentius also encouraged Christian merchants to settle in
Aksum. About a century later, Christianity in Ethiopia grew further as
the state offered refuge to Christians fleeing persecution due to
doctrinal disputes within the Church. Nine priests, breaking with the
Church in Jerusalem, settled in Ethiopia and founded the Ethiopian
Orthodox Church. They maintained ties with the Coptic Church in Egypt
and developed a distinct liturgy using Ge'ez, the local language.
Members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church also incorporated local
beliefs, such as the legendary connection to King Solomon, into their
religious traditions.

The ruling family, coastal elites, and military leaders amassed
significant wealth during the height of Aksumite power. Like the
Aksumite kings before him, Ezana amassed wealth by collecting tribute
from surrounding states and taxing trade. Aksum and its surrounding
states were agriculturally productive with fertile soils and effective
irrigation systems. Their agricultural productivity meant that the work
of peasants and the wealth generated through foreign trade supported the
ruling classes and elites. Building a powerful military, King Ezana
expanded the empire and claimed control over most of Ethiopia, Nubia,
and Saba (Yemen). He also used his assets to showcase his power with,
for example, "conquest stones" that commemorated his victories. In
addition to celebrating Ezana's military strength and commitment to
ruling fairly, the "conquest stones" also proclaimed that God had
ordained his reign. The stones impart Ezana's edicts and Christian
beliefs. One section reads:

> \[...\] The Lord of Heaven strengthens my dominion!
>
> And as he now has conquered my enemy, (so)
>
> May he conquer for me, where I (but) go! As
>
> he now has given me victory and has over
>
> thrown my enemies.
>
> (So will I rule) in right and justice, doing no
>
> wrong to the peoples. And I placed
>
> The throne, which I have set up, and the Earth
>

>
> of Heaven, who has made me
> king...[^\[8\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-8 "As quoted in Esperanza Brizuela-Garcia and Trevor Getz, African Histories: New Sources and New Techniques for Studying African Pasts (Boston: Prentice Hall, 2012): 33-36."){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-8
> .footnote aria-label="Footnote 8"}

Ezana is known to us because of archaeological findings, including the
aforementioned conquest stones. He and other Aksumite kings also
famously commissioned the construction of **stelae** (singular: stele).
Stelae were tall rectangular pillars with rounded tops set up to mark
the underground grave sites of Aksum's royalty and elite. The most
ornate stelae were elaborately carved into a marble-like material with
faux doors at the bottom and multiple stories, as indicated by windows
etched into each level. They have been described as "ancient
skyscrapers," with the largest being one hundred and eight feet tall.
Most stelae have fallen in the over 1700 years since their construction,
but several do remain standing. One stele even caused international
uproar as the Italians took it during their occupation of Ethiopia at
the onset of the Second World War and recently returned it at great
expense.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 195px">

Empire in Ethiopia. Author: User “Zhiem” Source: Wikimedia Commons

</figure>

The stelae demonstrate the wealth of Aksum's ruling classes and links
between the ruling generations. Unfortunately, the graves marked by the
stelae have been cleared out by tomb robbers in the intervening years.
However, small remnants of glass, pottery, furniture, beads, bangles,
earrings, ivory carvings, and objects gilded in gold attest to the
wealth buried with affluent Aksumites. These artifacts also show the
availability of trade goods brought from long distances. Furthermore,
the architecture of the stelae is suggestive of connections back to
earlier kingdoms. For example, the rounded top of the stelae is
reminiscent of the disc symbol found in the region as far back as the
Kingdom of Da'amat. Ezana was the first Christian king in the region;
however, the architecture that he commissioned maintained ties to
Aksum's pre-Christian past.

Aksum's power began to wane at the end of the sixth century CE. First,
the Persian Empire interrupted Aksum's trade with parts of southern
Arabia in the late sixth century. Then, Muslims increasingly dominated
trade along the Red Sea coast, and the most profitable trade routes
shifted from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. In response, Aksum shrank
as Ethiopia's Christian rulers turned away from coastal trade and became
more dependent on the tribute they collected from agriculturally
productive regions to their south.

As Muslims in coastal areas became more powerful and Christian rulers
shifted their attentions away from the coast, the relationship between
Ethiopian Muslims and Christians remained complex. In the seventh
century CE, one king of Aksum, al-Najashi Ashama Ibn Abjar, gave
sanctuary to some of the first followers of Islam before he himself
converted. In subsequent years, Muslims traders and Christian elites
oftentimes cooperated. For example, from the tenth through fourteenth
centuries, Muslims set up trading settlements in the interior that
facilitated the conspicuous consumption of Christian elites who desired
imported goods. However, there were also periods of conflict, especially
after Muslims unified to form the Adal Sultanate in the fourteenth
century. The Adal Sultanate militarily extended its influence over much
of the region and for several centuries supported a thriving,
multi-ethnic state. In the sixteenth century, Ethiopian Christians
allied with the Portuguese to fight against the Adal Sultanate. After
the fall of the Adal Sultanate, Ethiopian Christians rejected Portuguese
attempts to convert them to Catholicism and forced Portuguese
missionaries out of the region in 1633 CE.

## 9.7 THE WESTERN SUDANIC STATES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Who comes to mind as the richest person *ever*? Many economists and
historians propose a person who might surprise you: Mansa Musa. Mansa
Musa was an emperor in the Western Sudan during the Middle Ages. He was
so rich that the people of his own time could not even fathom his
wealth. Unable to put a dollar amount on Mansa Musa's bewilderingly
large fortune, Rudolph Ware, historian of Africa and Islam, instructs us
to "imagine as much gold as you think a human being could possess and
double
it..."[^\[9\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-9 "Jacob Davidson, “The 10 Richest People of All Time,” Time (July 2015)"){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-9
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 9"} Other sources estimate that, adjusted
for inflation, Mansa Musa was worth \$400
billion.[^\[10\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-10 "“Musa’s Money.” BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02f9r6g"){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-10
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 10"} How did Mansa Musa become so
wealthy? Like the other Western Sudanic African rulers, he controlled
much of the world's access to gold during a period when gold was in very
high demand.

</figure>

Map 9.4 shows the large area in West Africa commonly referred to as
**the Western Sudan**. The Western Sudan does not correspond with a
modern-day African country; instead, it is a region. Arabic-speaking
travelers gave the region its name, calling it *bilad-al-Sudan* or the
"Land of Blacks." The **Sahel**, which in Arabic means "the shore," is a
transition zone between the Sahara Desert to its north and the more
forested regions to its south. Much of the Sahel is grassland savannah.
Straddling regions with different climates, the people of the Western
Sudan developed productive agriculture, trade networks, and an urban
culture. The architecture of the Western Sudanic states stands out for
its use of mud (adobe) to construct its monumental buildings, such as
the Great Mosque in Djenne (Figure 9.9) and Askia the Great's tomb in
Gao (Figure 9.11). From roughly 800 to 1600 CE, the people of this
region organized and supported---sometimes under duress---the large
states that dominated the Western Sudan. Three of the best known of
these states became the empires of Ghana (800--1070s CE), Mali
(1230s--1430s CE), and Songhai (1460s--1591 CE).

</figure>

The leaders of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai came to dominate the region
because they controlled access to West African gold. An increase in the
demand for West African gold corresponded with the rise of these
empires. The spread of Islam and rise of new states along the North
African coast and in Europe gave the biggest boost to the demand for
gold. To meet the demand, Berber traders used newly introduced camels to
carry gold north across the desert. Then, they loaded up their camels
with big slabs of salt to return south. The people in many parts of West
Africa considered salt a valuable commodity due to their distance from
the ocean and the time required to extract salt from plant, animal, and
other resources. While the demands for gold and salt drove the trade,
weapons, manufactured goods, slaves, textiles, and manuscripts also
passed through the desert. With the flow of all of these goods, the
Western Sudanic states emerged at the nexus of the trans-Saharan trade
routes. The North African Berber traders crossing the Sahara Desert were
early converts to Islam, and they introduced Islam to market towns of
the Western Sudanic states. With continuing trade, the region's
connections with Northeast Africa and the Middle East grew through the
Middle Ages. Growing urban areas, like Timbuktu, attracted Muslim
scholars. In later centuries, the kings of Mali and Songhai deliberately
fostered these connections with the larger Islamic World due to their
religious beliefs and, sometimes, to enhance their status and secure
their positions. For example, Askia Muhammad, the king of Songhai from
1495 to 1528, successfully sought recognition as the "caliph of Sudan"
from Egyptian rulers. The new title brought him prestige within the
Islamic World and Africa. Therefore, trans-Saharan trade brought Islam
to the Western Sudan, and many of the kings of Mali and Songhai
cultivated their relationships with Muslims in Northeast Africa and the
Middle East. As a result, Islam influenced the culture and lifestyle,
particularly of urban residents, in the Western Sudan.

### 9.7.1 Ghana {.import-Header3}

We associate the first powerful empire, **Ghana** (800--1070s CE), with
people who spoke the Soninke language and lived in the area between the
Niger and Senegal Rivers---parts of present-day Mauritania and Mali. In
this region, agricultural productivity supported labor specialization,
urban areas, and eventually state formation. From as early as 300 BCE,
the region's farmers used iron tools to grow an abundance of crops,
including rice, millet, and vegetables. Iron technologies also allowed
craftsmen to make iron spears and swords so people could protect
themselves. Probably for defense purposes, Soninke speakers began
joining together to form the ancient state of Ghana around 300 CE. Then,
as the populations continued to grow, the state expanded its territory.

Even before Ghana was a state with a clearly defined centralized
administration, Soninke speakers had been involved in extensive systems
of trade using the region's complex river systems. They often acted as
middlemen, trading in fish from the rivers, meat from herders, and
grains from farmers. After 300 CE, Ghanian leadership began collecting
tributary payments from neighboring chiefdoms. In the centuries that
followed, Ghana's leaders used their ability to tax trade to build an
empire. By 800 CE, they had consolidated their control over trade, their
authority over urban areas, and their reign over tributary states.

Especially in the minds of the Arab scholars chronicling the history of
this period, the gold trade defined Ghana. They heard about the large
caravans with hundreds of camels passing through the Sahara Desert on
their way to and from Ghana. To build their fortunes, the Ghanian kings
taxed trade goods twice. They taxed gold when it was initially brought
from the forested regions in the south to their market towns and again
right as the Berber traders departed for the north. News of Ghana's
wealth spread to the extent that Medieval Arab scholars who had never
even traveled to Africa wrote about the Ghanian kings. In one
manuscript, Al-Bakri, an eleventh-century geographer based in Muslim
Spain, described how a Ghanian king was adorned in gold and guarded by
dogs wearing gold and silver collars. According to Al-Bakri, the king
demonstrated his power having his subjects "fall on their knees and
sprinkle dust on their heads" upon entering his
presence.[^\[11\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-11 "Quoted in “Kingdom of Ghana: Primary Source Documents.” African Studies Center. Boston University Pardee School of Global Studies. http://www.bu.edu/africa/outreach/k_o_ghana"){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-11
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 11"} The kings shored up their power
through their ostentatious displays of gold and their monopoly over
trade. Al-Bakri recognized the centrality of gold to the finances of the
Ghanian kings. According to him, the kings claimed all of the gold
nuggets for themselves, leaving only gold dust for everyone else. By
this time, the Ghanian kings had also used their wealth to build strong
armies, with archers and calvary, to collect tribute and carry out the
empire's expansion.

Al-Bakri's depiction of Ghana's capital city, Koumbi Saleh, also
evidences the introduction of Islam to the region. He described two
separate sites within the capital city, Koumbi-Saleh. To trade their
wares, the merchants used one site, which was clearly Muslim with
mosques, while the king lived in a royal palace six miles away. The
separation between the sites and lack of mosques near the royal palace
suggest that Islam had primarily impacted the market towns; the
leadership and masses of Ghana did not convert.

### 9.7.2 The Mali Empire {.import-Header3}

Due to attacks from the Muslim Almoravids from the North, issues with
overgrazing, and internal rebellions, Ghana declined in the eleventh
century, opening up an opportunity for the rise of Mali. The origins of
the **Mali Empire** (see Map 9.7) are associated with the king
**Sundiata Keita** (c. 1217--1255 CE). An epic, recounted orally by
griots for centuries and written down in various forms in the twentieth
century, relates the story of Sundiata's rise. One version written by
Guinean D. T. Niani in 1960 follows Sundiata as he overcomes a number of
challenges, like being unable to walk until he is seven years old, being
banished by a cruel stepmother, and facing tests given by witches. With
loyal followers and the attributes of a born leader, Sundiata overcomes
these and other challenges in the epic to found the new empire. Under
Sundiata, some of Mali's leadership converted to Islam; however, even
with conversion, they maintained important pre-Islamic traditions. The
epic demonstrates the prevalence of **syncretism** or the blending of
religious beliefs and practices in West Africa. For instance, the epic
traces Sundiata's background back to Bilali Bounama, one of the early
followers of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, and the powerful pre-Islamic
local clans of the lion and the buffalo. According to oral tradition,
Sundiata's ability to draw from both Muslim and traditional African
sources of strength allows him to overcome adversity and defeat his less
worthy opponents.

Like Sundiata, most of the subsequent kings of Mali combined Muslim and
local religious traditions. For example, they often completed the "Fifth
Pillar" of Islam by performing the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca
required of all able Muslims. In the meanwhile, they continued to use
pre-Islamic amulets, maintain their animistic beliefs, and consider
pre-Islamic sacred sites to be important. Similarly, when they
converted, the people living within Mali's cities and those involved in
trans-Saharan trade also blended Muslim and traditional beliefs and
practices.

Sundiata built the Mali Empire in the thirteenth century, and the empire
reached its height under Mansa Musa (c. 1280--1337 CE) in the early
fourteenth century. Through diplomacy and military victories, Sundiata
swayed surrounding leaders to relinquish their titles to him. Thus,
Sundiata established a sizeable empire with tributary states and became
the **mansa**, or emperor, of Mali. Most of the subsequent mansas of
Mali maintained their control over the gold-salt trade, the basis of
their wealth. Mali also developed a more diversified economy and was
recognized in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East as a prosperous
trading center.

**Mansa Musa**, who was likely Sundiata's grandson or grandnephew,
further developed the empire and made it one of the crossroads of the
Medieval Islamic World. Mansa Musa used a large army of approximately
100,000 soldiers to reunify the empire after several tumultuous decades.
Under Mansa Musa, Mali stretched much farther east, west, and south than
had its predecessor kingdom, Ghana. Farmers specialized in regional
crops, and the state operated farms where slaves grew food for the royal
family and the army. Mansa Musa also developed the empire's
administration, dividing the territory into provinces and appointing
competent governors.

With all of these achievements, Mansa Musa is best remembered for going
on the hajj from 1324 to 1325 CE. He attracted a great deal of attention
traveling in a huge caravan made up of almost 100 camels, 12,000 slaves,
and an estimated 30,000 pounds of gold. Local lore claims that he gave
out so much gold during his three-month stay in Cairo that the price of
gold dropped by 25%. Likewise, reportedly, after he passed through
Alexandria, the value of gold in the city stayed low for a decade. Mansa
Musa's impressive display in Northeast Africa and the Middle East
boosted Mali's standing in the Islamic World. After his return to Mali,
Mansa Musa further cultivated Islamic connections by building new
mosques and schools. He hosted Muslim scholars and made cities,
including **Timbuktu**, Djenne, and Gao, into centers of learning. Mansa
Musa also encouraged the use of Arabic, and the libraries, especially of
Timbuktu, became repositories of Islamic manuscripts. The **Catalan
Atlas** (Figure 9.10) demonstrates Mansa Musa's preeminence.
Commissioned by Charles V of France, the 1375 map shows Mansa Musa
ruling his empire. He sits atop a gold throne, wearing a gold crown,
carrying a gold scepter, and gauging (or perhaps admiring) a gold
nugget. Awash in gold in the Catalan Atlas, Mansa Musa paid for his
various projects by collecting tribute from surrounding states and
taxing trans-Saharan and inter-regional trade.

Several factors, including weak leadership, foreign invasions, and
rebellions within the tributary states, led to the decline of Mali after
Mansa Musa's death. The empire lost territory throughout the early
fifteenth century. With the decline of Mali, leaders in one of its
breakaway tributary states, Songhai (alternatively spelled Songhay),
expanded militarily and encroached on Mali's territory. By the late
1460s, when he captured Timbuktu, Songhai's leader Sunni Ali had begun
to build a new empire, the Songhai Empire, through military conquest.

### 9.7.3 Songhai {.import-Header3}

The **Songhai Empire** is most closely associated with the Sorko people
who lived alongside the Niger River, southeast of Gao. By about 800 CE,
the Sorko had created their own state, Songhai, trading along the river
and building a military that used war canoes. With the growth of
trans-Saharan trade and eventually the discovery of new gold fields, the
Sorko and other ethnic groups in the area established market towns in
Songhai. Most of the people who moved to these market towns converted to
Islam by the eleventh century. In the early fourteenth century, the Mali
Empire collected tribute from Gao, though other parts of the Songhai
state remained independent. Using his military to pick off pieces of
Mali in its waning years, Sunni Ali built the Songhai state into an
empire in the 1460s.

During its Golden Age, the Songhai Empire was ruled by **Askia Mohammad
I** (r. 1493--1528). Referred to as Askia the Great, Askia Mohammad I
was a devout Muslim, who centralized the empire's administration,
encouraged agriculture, and further expanded the state. Askia rose to
power as the general-in-chief of the army of Gao. He won a military
victory over Sunni Ali's son to found a new dynasty, the Askia dynasty.
As a devout Muslim, Askia went on the hajj to Mecca from 1496 to 1497.
The pilgrimage brought him international recognition and reinforced his
claims to power especially because the Sharif of Mecca bestowed Askia
with the title "the Caliph of the Sudan." Upon his return, Askia used
Islam to validate attacks on neighboring states, like the Mossi in 1498.
He also rebuilt Islamic centers. Leo Africanus, originally from Granada
(Spain), traveled through Timbuktu in 1526 and wrote,

> \[...\] There are in Timbuktu numerous judges, teachers, and priests,
> all properly appointed by the king. He greatly honors learning. Many
> hand-written books imported from Barbary \[the coastal regions of
> North Africa\] are also sold. There is more profit made from this
> commerce than from all other merchandise.
> [^\[12\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-12 "“Leo Africanus: Description of Timbuktu.” From The Description of Africa (1526). http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_ civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/leo_africanus.html"){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-12
> .footnote aria-label="Footnote 12"}

Under Askia, Timbuktu, Djenne, and Gao, once again, beckoned scholars
and people with commercial aspirations. Taxing gold remained an
important source of revenue for the king, but trade expanded to
incorporate items such as manuscripts, kola nuts, prisoners of war (who
were sold as slaves), horses, and cowry shells (which were used as an
internal currency). Additionally, to centralize his administration,
Askia appointed loyal Muslim governors to new provinces, replacing
hereditary rulers. After his death, Askia's sons, particularly his last
son, Askia Dawud (r. 1549--1582 CE) continued to generate wealth by
taxing trans-Saharan trade. Like their father, they also tended to
invest in Songhai's Islamic centers. For example, during the reign of
Dawud, there were approximately one hundred and fifty Islamic schools
operating in Timbuktu. Askia Dawud's death in 1582 saw the reemergence
of power struggles amongst competing rulers and rebellions within
tributary states, signaling the end of the Golden Age of Songhai.

Then, the biggest blow to the crumbling Songhai Empire came from the
invasion by Morocco in 1591. The Moroccan army used new technology,
muzzle-loading firearms, to defeat the Songhai troops. The Songhai state
limped along until 1737, but after 1591, it was no longer a unified
empire with control over numerous tributary states. For almost 1,000
years, large empires had dominated the Sahel. The leaders of Ghana,
Mali, and Songhai, each in turn, taxed trans-Saharan trade and grew
powerful. They built their empires with urban centers, strong
militaries, and numerous tributary states. However, the Moroccan
invasion eroded their power. Furthermore, the Age of Exploration, begun
by the Portuguese in their progress down the West Africa coast in the
fifteenth century, redirected trade. Trans-Saharan trade diminished and
was largely replaced by trade up and down the Atlantic coast of West
Africa.

## 9.8 THE SPREAD OF AGRICULTURE AND GREAT ZIMBABWE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Most of the languages indigenous to Africa belong to one of the major
language groups shown in Map 9.9. Over the past several decades,
historians of Africa have started to pay more attention to these
language groups. They use comparisons of core vocabulary words in
related languages to examine the spread of ancient technologies and the
interaction between peoples. Using linguistics (the study of languages),
historians corroborate information found in other sources, like oral
traditions of dynastic origins and archaeological findings.

Today's scholars are not the first ones to notice linguistic
similarities on the continent. During European colonization one hundred
and fifty years ago, anthropologists grouped Africans into "tribes"
based on presumed physical, cultural, and linguistic similarities. They
found that people in most of Sub-Saharan Africa spoke languages that
used the root --*ntu* to refer to person, with the prefix *ba* added in
the plural. Combining the root and the plural prefix, nineteenth-century
colonial anthropologists referred to people in these communities as
*Bantu* and later traced Bantu languages back to a root, a mother
language spoken in parts of Cameroon and Nigeria. To explain the
similarities in the languages, European scholars hypothesized that about
2,000 years ago, there was a **Bantu Migration**, a massive departure of
thousands of Bantu speakers from the Bantu homeland. As they described,
Bantu speakers imposed iron technology and traditions of agriculture on
the peoples they encountered in eastern and southern Africa. Influenced
by their own conceptions of colonization, nineteenth-century
anthropologists incorrectly portrayed the Bantu Migration as a rapid
conquest of Sub-Saharan hunter-gatherer societies by the technologically
advanced, Iron Age Bantu speakers.

Since the 1990s, historians of Africa have used linguistics to reject
some pieces of the nineteenth-century description of the Bantu
Migration. Referring instead to **Bantu expansions**, they generally
agree that the movement of Bantu speakers was more of a slow diffusion
of languages and technologies that lasted about 4500 years, from roughly
3000 BCE to 1500 CE. Bantu speakers took multiple routes, and sometimes
their movement occurred on the scale of a single family, as opposed to a
mass of thousands. From the linguistic evidence, historians also suspect
that both Bantu speakers and those they settled amongst contributed
ideas and technologies; there was mutual "teaching and learning from one
another."[^\[13\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-13 "As quoted in Brizuela-Garcia, Esperanza and Trevor Getz, African Histories: New Sources and New Techniques for Studying African Pasts. Boston: Prentice Hall, 2012: 43."){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-13
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 13"} The current view of the Bantu
expansions is much more complex as it recognizes give and take between
Bantu newcomers and indigenous populations. For example, some indigenous
populations rejected Bantu languages, while others repackaged Bantu
technologies incorporating their own innovations. There was no Bantu
migratory conquest of indigenous communities. Instead, the study of
linguistics seems to confirm that Bantu languages, iron-working, and
agriculture slowly spread through eastern and southern Africa in the
early centuries CE.

These corrections are important because they allow scholars to much more
accurately discuss state formation in southern and southeastern Africa.
In the colonial era, European scholars sometimes jumped to misleading
conclusions when they encountered evidence of early African states. For
example, in 1871, when the German geographer Carl Maunch saw the ruins
of an impressive civilization, Great Zimbabwe, he concluded that people
from Yemen must have built the grand structures. Biased by
nineteenth-century racism, Maunch assumed that Africans were incapable
of statehood and the skilled masonry techniques evident at Great
Zimbabwe. Subsequent Europeans reached similar conclusions upon viewing
the site, attributing the civilization to Phoenicians and Arabs. Some
white supremacists in southern Africa clung onto this fabricated history
of Great Zimbabwe's foreign origins until the early 1990s.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 450px">

Zimbabwe in the Mosvingo Province of present-day Zimbabwe. Author: User

</figure>

In the meantime, a number of scholars had confirmed the African origins
of Great Zimbabwe. Archaeologists showed that Great Zimbabwe had
features, like stone masonry and rituals involving cattle, found in
nearby African kingdoms. Historians used oral tradition and linguistics
to track African state formation in the region and show that Great
Zimbabwe was a Bantu civilization. Archaeologists and historians
concluded that from approximately 1200 to 1450 CE, **Great Zimbabwe**
was the thriving commercial and political center of a rich southern
African state.

During the Middle Ages, a prosperous elite based in Great Zimbabwe ruled
over about 300 settlements on the Zimbabwe Plateau. Great Zimbabwe and
the linked settlements had similarly constructed walled enclosures,
practiced mixed farming (they grew crops and kept livestock), and used
iron, copper, and bronze. The 300 settlements paid tribute in the form
of ivory, gold, cattle, and crops to the rulers in Great Zimbabwe. The
wealth generated through the collection of tribute helped Great Zimbabwe
become a center of trade and artistry. Great Zimbabwe exported gold and
ivory to cities like Sofala and Kilwa Kisanwani, on the East African
coast. From the coast, these goods were carried to the Persian Gulf,
India, and China. In exchange, Great Zimbabwe's elite imported luxury
items like stoneware, colored glass beads, and cotton. Out of these
imports, artisans based in Great Zimbabwe made jewelry, ornaments, and
cloth for elite consumption.

<figcaption>Figure 9.13 | The Hill Complex at Great Zimbabwe. Author:

</figure>

The architectural evidence of Great Zimbabwe's social hierarchies is one
of the most dramatic elements of the site's ruins. Covering three square
miles, the ruins of Great Zimbabwe consists of many clusters of stone
buildings. The most famous structures are the Hill Complex (Figure 9.13)
and the Great Enclosure (Figure 9.12). The stone buildings were
constructed with local granite, and the stones were stacked without
mortar, a process known as ashlar masonry. Scholars hypothesize that the
ruling elite resided and performed ceremonies on the Hill Complex,
symbolically demonstrating their authority with the height and
separation of the complex. From about 1300 CE, more than 15,000 people
lived in the valley below them in small, circular homes with thatched
roofs and walls made of clay and gravel. The Hill Complex overlooked a
number of other structures, including the famous Great Enclosure. With
its stone walls up to thirty-five feet tall, the Great Enclosure was the
largest structure in precolonial Sub-Saharan Africa. The Great Enclosure
was a ceremonial site, perhaps used by religious leaders or as a site
for the initiation of youth. Scholars disagree about its exact function
but suggest that the Great Enclosure further demonstrated the status and
wealth of the capital city and the ruling classes.

Great Zimbabwe declined in the fifteenth century and was abandoned by
1450 CE. Some scholars suggest that the site deteriorated because it was
supporting up to 30,000 people and thus became too crowded, deforested,
and stripped bare of resources through overuse. Surrounding gold mines
may have also been depleted. In any case, trade shifted to support the
rise of two new kingdoms, Batua to the west and Mutapa to the east. Both
kingdoms built stone walls like those seen in Great Zimbabwe and
practiced mixed agriculture, using cattle for ceremonies and as symbols
of the ruling elite's power. From the fifteenth through seventeenth
centuries, the kingdoms also faced the Portuguese and the influx of
other African populations. The Mutapa Kingdom lasted the longest,
enduring until 1760. Overall, this rewritten history of southern and
southeastern African statehood acknowledges the significance of the
Bantu expansions that brought agriculture and iron to many regions. It
also celebrates the African origins of great civilizations and
demonstrates how Africans shared technologies and cultural practices
across the Zimbabwean plateau.

## 9.9 THE SWAHILI CITY-STATES (EAST AFRICA) {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In the tenth century CE, a grand Persian sultan, Sultan Ali ibn Sulaiman
al-Shirazi, sailed to Kilwa Kisiwani, an island off the East African
coast. When he arrived, he was generous and people liked him, which
enabled him to marry the daughter of Mrimba, the local headman. The
newlyweds were set up to live more or less happily ever after. However,
Sultan Ali and Mrimba made a deal, brokered by Mrimba's daughter. The
deal gave Sultan Ali control of the island in exchange for enough cloth
for Mrimba to "walk on it from the island to his new abode on the
mainland."[^\[14\]^](#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_footnote-478-14 "John Middleton, The World of the Swahili: An African Mercantile Civilization, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994): 31-32."){#chapter-009-unknown-7.xhtml_return-footnote-478-14
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 14"} The deal went through, and Mrimba
moved to the mainland, but then Mrimba regretted relinquishing his
position and plotted to militarily retake the island from his
son-in-law. In response, Sultan Ali used magic from the Qur'an to stop
Mrimba's plot. By reading the Qur'an in a special way, Sultan Ali kept
the sea levels high, which confined Mrimba to the mainland, where he
gave up and retired. Upon Mrimba's death, his mainland territory passed
to the son of Sultan Ali who also ruled Kilwa Kisiwani. In this oral
tradition, the union of Mrimba's daughter and Sultan Ali forged a new
Muslim family, with Persian and African ancestry, that ruled Kilwa
Kisiwani and the mainland coast.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 387px">

alt="Map of The Swahili Coast of East Africa" />
<figcaption>Map 9.10 | The Swahili Coast of East Africa | From 1000 to

(present-day Mozambique). Author: George McCall Theal Source: Wikimedia

</figure>

The above version is just one account of **Kilwa Kisiwani's** origins;
nevertheless, it conveys some very important elements of Swahili
identity. Starting at least by the thirteenth century CE, in response to
resident Arab merchants who scorned non-Muslims and some African
practices, African elites in East Africa claimed descent from Shirazis
(Persians) and to have been early converts to Islam. In some cases, the
connections may have been exaggerated or inaccurate from a historical
standpoint. However, regardless of their accuracy, these stories
demonstrate some of the defining features of Swahili identity.

As it controlled gold coming from Great Zimbabwe, Kilwa Kisiwani became
one of the most prosperous of the Swahili city-states. From 1000 to 1500
CE, **Swahili city-states** were wealthy urban areas
connected [to]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}both
the African interior and the larger Indian Ocean World. Dozens of
Swahili city-states running down the East African coast from Mogadishu
to Sofala, and including islands off the coast, were commercial centers,
tied together by a shared identity, not an overarching political
structure. In addition to Islam and claims to Persian ancestry, Swahili
identity also became associated with Indian Ocean trade, an urban style,
and a shared language (Swahili).

Historians of Africa trace the origins of the Swahili city-states to the
Bantu expansions, explaining that by the first century CE, Bantu farmers
had built communities along the East African coast. They traded with
southern Arabia, southeast Asia, and occasionally Greece and Rome.
Although trade contracted after the fall of the Roman Empire, it
rebounded several hundred years later. At that time, residents of the
Swahili city-states played a pivotal role as middlemen, selling gold,
timber, ivory, resins, coconut oil, and slaves from the interior regions
of Africa to traders arriving from throughout the Indian Ocean World. In
return, Swahili elites bought imported glass, porcelain, silk, spices,
and cloth. The seasonal **monsoon winds** that allowed trade between the
Swahili coast and southern Arabia, the Persian Gulf, and southeast Asia
also facilitated cultural exchange. Blowing towards the East African
coast three to four months of the year and reversing several months
later, the monsoon winds stranded traders for months at a time,
encouraging intermarriage and cultural exchange. Furthermore, the wealth
of the Swahili coast attracted Persian and Arab immigrants. With
African, Arabian, and southeast Asian influences, Swahili culture became
a blended culture as, for example, the Swahili language incorporated
loan words from Arabic and Hindi.

One of the quintessential features of the Swahili city-states from 1000
to 1500 CE was their urban style. A few families made up the elite,
ruling classes, while most people in the cities were less wealthy,
working as craftsmen, artisans, clerks, and sailors. People in villages
along the coast could also identify as Swahili. Claimants of Swahili
identity spoke the Swahili language and were Muslim. Archaeology shows
that emerging Swahili cities had mosques and Muslim burial grounds
starting in the eighth century CE. By their height, the Swahili
city-states were distinctly Muslim; they had large mosques built of
local coral stone. The Swahili, regardless of their economic status,
drew a distinction between themselves as Muslims and the "uncultured,"
non-Muslim Africans of the interior.

urban Swahili architecture. Author: Claude McNab Source: Wikimedia

</figure>

The elite families played a role in fashioning Swahili urban style. In
addition to tracing their descent back to some of the earliest Muslim
settlers from Persia, they embraced Islam, financing mosques, practicing
purdah (the seclusion of women), and hosting large religious
celebrations. Their Muslim identity stimulated trade, as visiting Muslim
merchants felt comfortable extending credit to them and living with
their Swahili host families while waiting for the winds to turn. By 1350
CE, the urban style of Swahili city-states exhibited a distinguishing
architecture. Many of the cities became "stone towns" with wealthy
Swahili families constructing multi-level homes out of the coarse coral.
The Swahili elite used their stone houses to establish themselves as
prominent, creditworthy citizens. They wore imported silk and cotton and
ate off imported porcelain to further display their status. Like other
Swahili, the ruling classes distinguished themselves from non-Muslims of
the interior. They may have been partially moved to draw this
distinction by their desire to sell [humans]{.underline} as slaves [who
were]{.underline} captured in the neighboring, non-Muslim communities.

Slavery within the **Indian Ocean World**, the zone of contact and
interaction connecting people living adjacent to the Indian Ocean, began
well before the spread of Islam in the seventh century CE. During the
high point of the Swahili city-states, Muslim traders controlled the
slave trade within the Indian Ocean World. Slaves tended to be captives
of war sold to the Arabian Peninsula and regions near the Persian Gulf.
Slaves were put to work as sailors, agricultural laborers, pearl divers,
domestic workers, concubines, and musicians. Our information about the
everyday lives of slaves in this region is very limited.

In one famous revolt, slaves from East Africa (the Zanj), who were
forced to work on sugar plantations and salt flats near Basra (in
present-day Iraq), seriously challenged the power of the Abbasid
Caliphate in the 9th century. Led by Ali ibn Muhammad, the Zanj rose up
in the **Zanj Rebellion**, a guerrilla war against the Abbasids. For
fourteen years, the Zanj and their supporters, altogether an estimated
15,000 people, raided towns, seized weapons and food, and freed slaves.
They captured Basra and came within seventy miles of Baghdad, the
Abbasid capital. The rebels created their own state with fortresses, a
navy, tax collection, and their own coinage. At enormous cost, the
Abbasids finally put down the revolt in 883 CE using a large army and by
offering amnesty to the rebels. Scholars have used the Zanj Rebellion to
examine the scope of the Indian Ocean trade in East African slaves, the
conditions of slavery in the Indian Ocean World, and the agency (the
ability to exert their own will) of slaves. Some of these scholars
suggest that the Zanj Rebellion led Muslims in Arabia to largely abandon
the practice of using East African slaves as plantation laborers. The
rebellion helps them explain why the Indian Ocean slave trade developed
differently than the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

While there were some similarities between the trans-Atlantic trade that
brought slaves to the Americas and the slave trade within the Indian
Ocean World, there were important differences. Both slave trades took
Africans, contributing to an **African diaspora**, or a dispersal of
African peoples and their descendants, all over the world. The
trans-Atlantic slave trade, which lasted approximately 300 years and
reached its peak in the eighteenth century CE, forced approximately 12
million people, mostly from West Africa, into the Americas. The slave
trade within the Indian Ocean lasted much longer, about 2000 years, and
was generally smaller in scale but still involved roughly 10 million.
Scholars suggest that African slaves in the Indian Ocean World had more
social mobility, especially since many of them were skilled soldiers.
Also, according to Islamic precepts, slaves had some basic rights and
could be incorporated into the households that they served.
Theoretically, a freeborn Muslim could not be enslaved. Unlike slavery
in the Americas, slavery within the Indian Ocean World was not racially
codified, so freed slaves did not automatically face racial
discrimination. And due to their reproductive capacities, women were
more sought after as slaves within the Indian Ocean World, while the
trans-Atlantic slave trade had the highest demand for young men. Despite
these general trends, there was great individual variation within the
slave experience.

Moving up the East African coast in the late fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries, the Portuguese sacked some Swahili cities and tried
to tax trade. In 1498, when they happened upon the Swahili coast, the
Portuguese were trying to establish a direct sea route to the riches of
India and China. After using an East African guide to reach India, the
Portuguese began to set up a **Trading Post Empire**, which intended to
tax trade within the Indian Ocean. The Trading Post Empire consisted of
a series of forts along the Indian Ocean coast where Portuguese
administrators collected taxes and issued trade permits. In the early
1500s, the Portuguese returned to the Swahili city-states to enforce
their will. As the Swahili city-states did not have a unified political
structure or large armies, the Portuguese successfully looted and
destroyed some Swahili cities. However, the Portuguese cultural
influence and their ability to enforce tax collection was very limited
north of Mozambique. The Portuguese did not move inland beyond the
coastal cities, and by and large, trade within the Indian Ocean
continued without a great deal of Portuguese interference. However, the
Portuguese presence encouraged Swahili leaders to ally with the Omanis
from southern Arabia. In 1699, the Omanis, working with some Swahili
rulers, seized Mombasa from the Portuguese and began an era of Omani
dominance of the Swahili coast.

## 9.10 CONCLUSION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

These African states showcase the continent's connections to the rest of
the world, a multitude of African innovations, and the importance of
using a variety of methodologies to interrogate long-held assumptions
about Africa. Africa was not isolated. Instead, oceans and deserts were
"highways" in these periods. Aksum, the Western Sudanic states, Great
Zimbabwe, and the Swahili coast were all commercially linked to Europe,
the Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf, southeast
Asia, and even China. Although there were local differences, the ruling
classes in each of the states collected tribute from outlying areas and
participated in long-distance trade. The wealth of these states
supported labor specialization, urbanization, and other innovations.

African states contributed to great cultural change. As just one case in
point, Ethiopia, the Western Sudanic states, and the Swahili city-states
all experienced religious transformations. Not only did Ethiopia serve
as a sanctuary for both Christians and Muslims, but Ethiopians also
established their own Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Starting in
the thirteenth century CE, Western Sudanic rulers converted to Islam,
maintaining some of their pre-Islamic beliefs while building their
connections with the rest of the Islamic World. Medieval African cities
like Timbuktu benefitted from these connections. They attracted traders
as reports of African gold circulated far and wide. Taxing the gold
trade, Western Sudanic rulers developed these cities as both trading
depots and places of scholarly learning. The Swahili in coastal East
Africa also embraced Islam as one of the defining features of their
identity. Their urban style reflected the centrality of Islam, which
they believed distinguished them as cultured and refined. All four
states also developed numerous other innovations, such as those in art,
architecture, metal-working, agriculture, and political organization.

Before the twentieth century, foreigners recorded much of Africa's
written history. There are limitations to their accounts, meaning that a
number of written documents about Africa are misleading, at best. Many
African societies remembered their own histories orally, using
professionalized classes of historians, storytellers, and musicians, in
addition to proverbs and the teachings of elders. Over the past fifty
years, historians of Africa have done more to incorporate Africa's oral
traditions into their examination of the ancient past. They have also
used linguistics and archaeology to create a more accurate written
history of the continent and reclaim African civilizations.

> .footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"}

The above is from Hernán Cortez's description of **Tenochtitlán**, the
Aztec capital he and his Tlazcalan allies conquered in 1521. As the
Spanish explorers in the Americas, and later the French, English, and
Dutch, saw monetary gain from reporting their exploits to their
respective monarchs, we often end up with a stilted or incomplete
version of the Americas before 1500. Part of this can be attributed to
the bias of European explorers and misinterpretation of Native American
beliefs and practices.

Arguably, the most misunderstood practice was that of human sacrifice
witnessed by the Spanish conquerors of the Aztec Empire. Among
Mesoamerican and Andean peoples, there was a belief that all
life---cosmic, human, animal, and plant alike---grew beneath the soil
and sprung forth above the surface. Furthermore, humans had a role in
nurturing that life cycle. In many of the cultures we will discuss,
**shamanism** was an important religious tradition whereby shamans or
religious specialists could control the forces of the natural world.
Often, shamans would conduct ceremonies requiring sacrifice from members
of their community to ensure cosmic and earthly order. While the Spanish
tend to focus on more dramatic ceremonies where hearts are cut from
living warriors, other kinds of sacrifices in Mesoamerica and the Andes
were integrated in hundreds of ways into daily life. For many cultures,
ritual bloodletting was a widespread practice, but one where the injured
party survived to perform the ceremony the next year. Oftentimes,
human-shaped grain cakes would serve as stand-ins for actual human
participants. Most sacrifices in fact were actually offerings or prayers
to Mesoamerican or Andean deities. For example, a Nahua newborn might be
named in honor of Maya rulers. Or the first corn tortilla of the day
might be consumed in honor of the
sun.[^\[2\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-2 "Kay Almere Read and Jason J. Gonzalez, Handbook of Mesoamerican Mythology (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2000), 25-26."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"} These beliefs would eventually be
manifest in physical structures like a cave under Teotihuacán's Pyramid
of the Sun in Mexico or sunken plazas at Chavín de Huantar in Peru and
Tiwanaku in Bolivia. These sacred spaces were constructed beneath the
earth's surface to allow the cultures aboveground easier access to the
earth's creative capacity.

As historians, it also is helpful to point out some of our myopic
tendencies regarding the peopling of the Americas. In Chapter One, we
talked about discrepancies regarding the date at which *Homo sapiens*
arrived in the Americas. While there is evidence supporting an overland
migration from Beringia, and geographically speaking the Beringia
migration is the most logical explanation, some scholars argue that this
approach has become "dogma" and even "ideology," leaving no room for
evidence that may challenge this explanation. While we cannot argue that
we are close to abandoning the Beringian migration as the most likely
theory, there is mounting evidence that suggests a seaborne migration
from Asia or even a "Solutrean" migration from Europe ten thousand years
before an ice-free corridor opened up in North
America.[^\[3\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-3 "Bruce Bradley and Dennis Stanford, “The North Atlantic Ice-Edge Corridor: A Possible Palaeolithic Route to the New World,” World Archaeology 36:4 (December 2004):460."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-3
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 3"}

A third weakness in our narrative of the Americas involves the
demographic collapse of the indigenous population that occurred after
the arrival of European diseases. Especially in the Circum-Caribbean,
millions of indigenous peoples succumbed to European disease and
overwork in the first decades of the sixteenth century, giving them
little opportunity to construct their own historical narrative apart
from the one that Europeans were writing.

Keeping these limitations in mind, our task in this chapter is to
examine a pre-Columbian history where in a little over 15,000 years,
migrants most likely from Asia populated the Americas by foot, built
hundreds of major cities, supported a population in the tens of
millions, and constructed two of the most impressive empires the world
has known. Recent advances in archaeology and calendrics have helped us
uncover much of this pre-Columbian past that had been largely clouded by
our obsession with the triumph and tragedy of the European conquest.

## 10.5 MESOAMERICA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

This discussion of the Americas before 1500 begins in the "middle."
Although scholars believe that people migrated to Beringia and hence
North America first, **Mesoamerica** was the first section of the
Americas where scholars have found evidence of large settlements,
agriculture, and unique cultural traditions, so this chapter starts
there. The Mesoamerican culture area is found in what are now the modern
countries of Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, and eastern
Honduras. The region's frequent volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and
hurricanes gave it quite a staggering amount of ecological diversity,
including mountains, coastal plains, and a peninsular limestone platform
(the Yucatán). The region's climatic diversity is attributable to the
fact that it sits in both tropical and subtropical latitudes.

Less is known about migration to Mesoamerica than for North and South
America during the Paleo-Indian Period, but many scholars put people in
the region by 15,000 BCE. These early residents hunted large and small
game and consumed a wide range of plant resources. The Archaic Period in
Mesoamerica stretched from 8000 to 2000 BCE, during which scores of
cultures adapted to the region's ecological diversity by domesticating
wild food sources like "beans, squash, amaranth, peppers, and wild Maize
(*teosinte*)."[^\[4\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-4 "Michael E. Smith and Marilyn A. Masson, eds., The Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica: A Reader, (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000), 8."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-4
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 4"} The maize of large kernels of today
took thousands of years of domestication for Mesoamericans to produce,
but by the Formative Period, it was a staple crop supporting tens of
thousands. Groups living closer to the coast could also take advantage
of wetland crops, such as manioc.

### 10.5.1 Early Farming in Mesoamerica {.import-Header3}

Just as early farmers in Southwest Asia turned wild plants into domestic
crops, so too did their contemporaries in Mesoamerica with maize,
squash, and tubers. Foragers in the southern Mexican highlands lived on
a diverse diet of plants and animals, including cactus fruit, corn,
squash, beans, fish, deer, and rabbits. Their contemporaries in the
tropical lowlands further south consumed tubers like manioc, sweet
potato, and arrowroot as well as fruits like avocados. While
Mesoamericans did domesticate most of these crops, they did so before
becoming sedentary, a fact revealing the existence of regional
variations in the path to agriculture. Around 10,000 years ago,
Mesoamericans began to cultivate squash, both as a food source and as
storage containers. Rather than staying near their cultivated land,
however, early planters formed mobile "agricultural bands" that still
hunted and would return to harvest mature squash or chilies. Over time,
these bands planted more and hunted less until eventually they formed
sedentary agricultural villages. But that process took at least 2,000
years. In fact, it may have been in the much denser tropics in and
around Panama where residents first left foraging behind for
agriculture. Around 10,000 BCE, after the extinction of megafauna, these
tropical peoples began to cultivate their forest environment. Tropical
cultivation tended to be cramped, but tropical residents did manage to
domesticate the tubers like manioc, sweet potato, and arrowroot that we
mentioned
above.[^\[5\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-5 "Ristvet, 43-46."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-5
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 5"}

Over the next several centuries, village dwellings themselves revealed a
growing emphasis on permanence and increasing sophistication. Brick
walls and plaster floors began to replace hides and sticks. New
rectangular houses appeared, allowing for expansion by extending walls
and adding a perpendicular end wall. Expanding permanent dwellings
allowed villages to grow through natural population increase. Permanent
dwellings also helped establish distinctions between public and private
space and public and private activities, affecting communal and private
property. Not only did villages have to decide where and how to build,
they also had to organize around when to plant, where to settle, when to
harvest, and where to store the food. The invention of pottery during
this period served storage needs. Tasks in construction, gathering,
defense, and food production became more specialized and supervised,
leading to the beginnings of class. The elite developed a strata usually
comprising warriors, priests, and administrators.

### 10.5.2 The Formative Period {.import-Header3}

By the beginning of the Formative Period around 2000 BCE, most residents
of Mesoamerica were sedentary, many living in small bands that moved
only
seasonally.[^\[6\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-6 "Christopher Pool, Olmec Archaeology and Early Mesoamerica, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 7."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-6
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 6"} However, by 300 CE, many of these
small bands had been replaced by quite common large urban centers.
Improved technologies such as domesticated crops and the use of pottery
vessels for storage possibly increased the accelerated transition to
more urban living. Pottery appeared between 1900 BCE and 1750 BCE on the
Pacific coast of **Chiapas** in highland valleys and on the Gulf coast.
After about 1400 BCE, scholars began noticing widespread sharing of
obsidian, shell, jade, and iron artifacts, a sharing which denotes
significant interaction by this point. A social hierarchy also began to
develop in Chiapas, where there was a two-tiered settlement hierarchy of
small centers and villages. In other words, the elite had bigger houses.
Over time and in more areas, plastered floors and dirt floors appeared
in different dwellings and altars in others. Burials also indicated
social differentiation within the tribal bands.

The **Olmec** were the earliest civilization in Mesoamerica and,
therefore, drove much of this rapid development. The Olmec developed
along the Gulf of Mexico and flourished during the Early Formative and
Middle Formative (1500--400 BCE), while the Late Formative (400 BCE--100
CE) saw their evolution and transformation. Scholars use this timeline
with the caveat that Mesoamerica houses a number of unique cultural
traditions, and there are variations within this timeline in terms of
when they developed urbanization, states, agriculture, and certain
technologies. The Olmecs' most notable accomplishment was their
monumental stone sculptures. Other Mesoamerican cultures had stone
monuments, but the Olmec versions were unique in their sophistication,
size, and number. A common theme occurs during the coherent tradition
spanning 1400 BCE to 400 BCE. Statues were carved out of thrones or in
low relief on stelae. The largest of them weighed over forty tons.
Stones had been transported as much as ninety kilometers from their
sources. The labor required to do this demonstrates the power of these
rulers. Aside from statue carving, Olmec elites also commissioned carved
columns, drains, and embellishments in large houses. An inordinate
amount of iron trade also occurred, and objects like polished iron
mirrors were found in the tombs of high-ranking individuals. The import
of jade sculptures was perhaps even more prominent, with thousands of
tons of "serpentine blocks" buried in massive offerings at the Olmec
center of **La** **Venta** in southern
Mexico.[^\[7\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-7 "Pool, 15."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-7
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 7"}

Many of these monuments were commissioned by or for elite members of an
increasingly sophisticated socio-economic hierarchy first seen in the
Early Formative Olmec of **San Lorenzo.** San Lorenzo itself stood at
the apex of a three- or four-tiered settlement hierarchy which included
subordinate centers, villages, and special purpose sites. This
increasing sophistication became solidified through Olmec politics as
well. Early in the Formative Period, most groups were organized in
tribes, but the Olmec soon began to form a set of chiefdoms that allowed
for organized leadership across generations, albeit through kinship
ties. The Olmec also became the first civilization in the region to
develop a state, where the same hierarchy became more stratified and
institutions became more specialized.

Some scholars even call the Olmec an "empire," but most say it falls
short for a few important reasons. First, the Olmec never had a large
enough population at their disposal to form a conquering army. Second,
while there existed a number of significant urban Olmec sites, such as
La Venta and San Lorenzo, none of them has been identified as an Olmec
capital. Finally, the art and archeological records of surrounding
societies [indicate]{style="font-size: 1em;"} [not
]{style="font-size: 1em;"}an Olmec domination but rather the existence
of something of a theocratic state, as elites seemed to have both
political and religious authority and a considerable amount of
influence.

Final questions related to our understanding of the region are: Why did
the Olmec evolve at all, and why did they evolve when they did? One
theory involves the ecological relationship to Mesoamerica's lowland
environment. Another holds that increasing productivity led to high
population growth, which resulted in a necessity to organize
politically. Control of these resources as well as the limited use of
warfare accounted largely for the authority of individual chieftains.
Other scholars have added to this observation, pointing out that the
abundance but lack of diversity of Olmec area agriculture forced them to
develop a competitive advantage with neighboring societies that lived
closer to obsidian, salt, and stone deposits. (The Olmec would need to
trade for these resources that were central for hunting and food
production.) Once the Olmec did manage to organize as states, they began
to plan for their permanence.

From the above-mentioned stone deposits, the Olmec produced their
cultural hallmark: monumental stone sculptures. Around 1650 BCE, the
Olmec began to produce stone effigy bowls, but these are much smaller
than the monumental sculptures that followed. Over 200 known monumental
stone sculptures remain; one-third are from San Lorenzo and the
surrounding area. The colossal heads are the largest; some stand up to
three and a half meters tall. Each head is unique, containing its own
ear ornaments, headdress, specific facial features, and expressions.
Most scholars think they are portraits. Tabletop altars have been found
in a range of sizes across Olmec sites. Most now believe they served as
thrones, but others believe they served as altars as well. They often
show humans emerging from a niche in front of the monument. The Olmec
also crafted smaller sculptures. These smaller sculptures incorporated
human and supernatural themes or humans in ritual or symbolic postures.
A fourth sculptural style, one that corresponds to later periods, was
stelae. These stelae often depicted supernatural beings and elaborately
dressed individuals engaged in specific actions. These stone sculptures
would be impressive for modern humans to achieve but are made more
impressive considering the fact that the Olmec possessed no metal tools
with which to cut them.

</figure>

The purpose behind these sculptures, outside of their artistic value,
seems to have involved monumentality. Stone as a whole gave a sense of
order, stability, and equilibrium. The harmonic proportions in the works
enhanced those ideas. The sculptures also contained a good enough mix of
naturalism and abstraction to give a nod to the spiritual world as well.
As shamanists, the Olmec believed a direct connection existed between
order on earth and order in the spiritual world. Olmec shamans, through
ritual and through the assistance of their ***nagual*** (also referred
to as *nagualo*) or "animal spirit companions," could travel to the
supernatural world or guard against spirits who desired them
harm.[^\[8\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-8 "F. Kent Reilly III, “Art, Ritual and Rulership in the Olmec World,” In Smith and Masson, eds., 374."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-8
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 8"} Therefore, a number of altars and
smaller sculptures show human-jaguar or human-dragon anthropomorphs,
particularly those that reflect the existence of a gateway or portal
between worlds. La Venta Altar 4, for example, had an earthly purpose as
a throne and a symbolic one as a cosmological model. When the Olmec
ruler sat on the throne, he could be present in both the natural and
supernatural realms. This journey between worlds was aided by the
intercession of the ruler's animal spirit companion (in this case, a
jaguar).[^\[9\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-9 "Ibid., 393."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-9
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 9"}

The Olmec undoubtedly left a lasting legacy on the Caribbean coast of
Mesoamerica, but the legacy can be difficult to trace, as much of it has
been subsumed into a debate about its being a "mother" culture for the
Aztec and Maya. (Recent scholarship has given less credence to the Olmec
as a "mother culture" and argues that it developed independently of Maya
and Valley of Mexico cultures.)

## 10.6 THE MAYA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The influence of the Olmec on the Maya may seem superficial, but it is
quite important, as the Maya's rise to sophistication was so fast it
almost defies explanation. After settling at the base of the Yucatán
Peninsula around 1000 BCE, the lowland Maya learned how to deal with
drought, feed tens of thousands of people, and organize
politically---all before 250 BCE.

The Late Classic period was one of tremendous growth. The city of
**Tikal**, in present-day Guatemala, had reached a population of 80,000
by CE 750, while the population of its rival Calakmul reached 50,000. To
support these large populations, the Late Classic Maya had almost a
totally engineered landscape that included water management projects,
flattened ridge tops, and terraced hillsides. The population was fairly
dense in cities and in the surrounding countryside. Their leaders had
tombs built in their honor and imported luxury items like jade statues,
feathers, cacao, and other items from the Mexican Highlands.

The Late Classic Maya also had an advanced numerical annotation system
of dots and bars and used the numeral zero. Mayan writing began as
pictographs and blended into quite artistic symbolism. In addition to
their more than seven hundred carved monuments, the Maya produced wooden
carvings, incised jades, and pottery.

Maya were never unified under one ruler or even a set of rulers.
Instead, the Maya were a civilization that shared a set of cultural
traits and a language family but no single ruler or sense of common
identity. Individual Maya kingdoms rose and fell, but none was ever able
to dominate the entire Maya area.

Maya rulers held tremendous power and prestige within their kingdoms.
Rulers were kings at the top of a "steep" social hierarchy that was
reinforced by religious beliefs. The king was a hereditary ruler chosen
by the gods and a member of one of several elite bloodlines. The Maya
priestly class organized a complex pantheon of both gods and deified
ancestors.

This ancestor worship required not only ceremony and temple building but
a complex understanding of calendrics as well. Both the Maya and the
Olmec understood time as "a set of repeating and interlocking cycles
instead of the linear sequence of historical
time,"[^\[10\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-10 "Matthew Restall and Amara Solari, 2012 and the End of the World: The Western Roots of the Maya Apocalypse. (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2011)."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-10
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 10"} much as the concept is understood
today. Long cycles alternated with short cycles; the long periods
involved the repeated creations and destructions of the world in their
creation stories. Since cycles are by definition repeated, certain dates
are more important than others because they are attached to good and bad
events in the past. Calendar priests determined what those dates were
and therefore held considerable power. They also had the power to
rewrite the course of events if this benefited the
ruler.[^\[11\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-11 "Ibid."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-11
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 11"}

### 10.6.1 Teotihuacán and the Toltec {.import-Header3}

While the Olmec and Maya accomplished incredible things, urbanization to
the north in Mexico's central valley may have left the most permanent
legacy. To the north of the Maya culture area, the Valley of Mexico was
the most "agriculturally desirable" zone in Mesoamerica. Climate was
temperate, and rainfall, although not abundant, was predictable---in
contrast to the drenching rains of tropical Mesoamerica. Lesser amounts
of rainfall, of course, required aqueducts, reservoirs, and canals if a
city were to thrive. Cuicuilco was such a city that rose to prominence
in the Valley of Mexico by 150 BCE, only to be badly damaged by a
volcanic eruption around 400 CE. The subsequent decline of Cuicuilco
allowed a competing city, **Teotihuacán**, to rise to prominence in the
area, and by 100 CE, its population reached 60,000 inhabitants. By 550
CE, Teotihuacán was one of the six largest cities in the world, with a
population of 125,000. Teotihuacán covered more than 20 square
kilometers and had a marketplace, an administrative center, and several
different types of housing. Its largest buildings seem to have had both
a functional and a spiritual use. The Pyramid of the Sun, the largest
building in the city, was built over a sacred cave likely connected with
creation myths. By the fourth century CE, Teotihuacán had the modern
equivalent of neighborhoods; new houses were laid out on a rough grid,
with many homes organized into apartment
compounds.[^\[12\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-12 "Adams, 46-49."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-12
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 12"} The dwellings were constructed of
volcanic rock, mortar, and wood for the roofs. The compounds also had a
system of underfloor drains. Many of the dwellings in these complexes
are decorated with "polychrome wall murals" containing multiple
religious themes and military themes, some depicting play or everyday
life.[^\[13\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-13 "Ibid."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-13
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 13"}

To support its massive population, Teotihuacán needed to secure supplies
and tribute from surrounding areas. Many neighboring areas were
conquered through a combination of trade and military conquest. Force
was used to secure trade routes to the south and thus have access to
goods as diverse as cacao beans, tropical bird feathers, salt, medicinal
herbs, and honey. Once the city's influence had expanded and it had
become the region's undisputed merchant power, its subsistence base
increased to include the entire Basin of Mexico and some neighboring
peoples like the Tlazcala. The reach of Teotihuacán's leadership even
extended into Maya kingdoms like Tikal, where it influenced, and may
have even ousted, a Maya ruler in the late fourth century. Tikal's
position within its own region may in fact have been strengthened by
this subordination to
Teotihuacán.[^\[14\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-14 "Adams, 48-49."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-14
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 14"}

Teotihuacán was able to sustain impressive growth and expansion for more
than five centuries, but ultimately, its size and complexity seemingly
contributed to its decline. At about 650 CE, roughly half of
Teotihuacán's public buildings and a number of temples, pyramids, and
palaces were burned. Many were knocked down and torn asunder. This seems
to have been the work of not invaders but instead internal and external
groups who attacked declining symbols of power.

The Late Classic Maya would also experience a collapse of their cultural
systems around 840 CE. Years of population growth and demands on and
from the elite came to a head with a period of prolonged drought in the
early ninth century. Resulting famines and infighting caused population
losses in Maya settlements nearing eighty-five percent, and in many
areas, abandoned farmlands were retaken by the
forest.[^\[15\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-15 "Ibid., 60-65."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-15
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 15"}

While many of these Late Classic Maya sites would never recover from
their demographic decline, Mesoamerica remained fertile, and southern
Mexico remained temperate, so a number of polities rose to prominence in
the area after the above-mentioned declines. Tula, which had been
founded by Teotihuacán leaders as an administrative center, emerged in
the Valley of Mexico after 650 CE. Tula would become the capital of the
**Toltecs**, who saw their principal city grow to a population of 35,000
by 800 CE. Like all Mesoamerican cities at the time, Tula would expand
its influence through trade. Toltec ceramics were found in regions
ranging from Costa Rica to Guatemala, while Toltec-style I-shaped ball
courts and rain dances were adopted by cultures like the Anasazi and
Hohokam in modern-day Arizona and New Mexico. One of these ball courts
still sits near the modern city of Phoenix,
Arizona.[^\[16\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-16 "Ibid., 69-71."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-16
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 16"} While much of the Hohokam culture
area sits in what is now the United States, it was heavily influenced by
the culture of Mexico. The Hohokam also erected platform mounds and dug
irrigation canals like those found in Mexico.

One important difference that the Toltec developed from their
predecessors was their desire to conquer. Perhaps influenced by the
rapid decline of Teotihuacán, the Toltec wanted to rise to prominence
quickly. Their construction of Tula was hasty, and conflict with
neighbors went beyond typical captive taking or territorial gain. The
Toltec viewed their conquest as a "sacred war" where man would aid the
gods in their fight against the powers of darkness. The Toltec
eventually merged their sacred war with that of the northern Maya in the
Puuc Hills of the Yucatán. The northern Maya elites had already adopted
"divine war" when the Toltec invaded the Yucatán city of Chichén.
Chichén would become the Toltec administrative center in the peninsula
in the late tenth century, but they did not completely drive out the
city's Maya founders. In fact, the Itza Maya ruled the region under the
Toltec and continued to do so well into the post-Columbian
period.[^\[17\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-17 "Ibid., 69-75."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-17
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 17"}

## 10.7 THE AZTEC {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

While the Itza were one of the last unconquered native civilizations in
the New World, another post-classic kingdom drew the most attention from
Mexico's Spanish conquerors: the Aztec. The Aztec capital was the
magnificent city of **Tenochtitlán**, founded around 1325 CE by a
previously nomadic group called the Mexica. Tenochtitlán was composed of
a network of dozens of smaller city-states who used the lake environment
to plant wetland gardens and used raised causeways to separate the
gardens and move around the city. Some fields were raised as well, a
feat which drained them and helped contribute to supporting a population
that totaled around 300,000 people (including the population of the
neighboring city of Texcoco). Eventually, a network of canals was
created that drained fields, fed crops, and provided for navigation with
canoes. Not only were these raised fields a source of multiple crops,
but also the lake provided wildfowl, salamanders, and algae.

However, as the population grew to over a million, other means of
support were needed, so the people looked to outside tribute. Beginning
in 1428, the Mexica sought independence from their Tepanec patrons and
allied with other outlying towns to form the Triple Alliance, which by
1431 dominated the basin where they made their home. The unified Aztec
people were led by the Mexica ruler Itzcoatl and his advisors. In making
an alliance with Texcoco, the Aztec were able to build a causeway
between the cities and help improve the infrastructure of Tenochtitlán.
They then began construction on the Great Temple, a central market, and
a larger network of gardens or ***chinampas***. The Great Temple would
become the orienting point for the entire city and would become the site
of thousands of human sacrifices.

</figure>

The Aztec are perhaps best known for practicing human sacrifice.
However, the context in which these sacrifices take place reveals that
they were not conducted in a wanton or random manner. First of all, for
the new Aztecs, there was little tradition of and, therefore, little
opportunity for community building to draw upon. Their rise to power had
to have been quick and dramatic. Furthermore, they possessed a worldview
that held that even though they had achieved greatness, decline was
inevitable. This view was present in their philosophy and their
ceremonies---including those of sacrifice. This view was also important
for ritual victims because upon their death, they believed that they
would be freed from the burdens of the uncertain human condition and
become a carefree hummingbird or butterfly.

For the Aztec, ritual provided a kind of protection against excess;
there was order in it, even if it was violent. Men had no independent
power, and gods were very abstract in their doling out of gifts.
Finally, in the Mexica worldview, the earth receives rather than gives.
Through fertility and death, humans satisfy that hunger. The process of
birth and death is not "dust to dust" but the transition from one form
of flesh to another. All man can do is order his portion of this natural
cycle.

## 10.8 EARLY ANDES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Humans arrived in South America after migrating through North and
Mesoamerica; they began to craft small campsites and fishing villages
along the Pacific coast. Around 3,000 BCE, the small campsites villages
were replaced by residential and ceremonial centers. This transition was
made possible through a new focus on irrigation and communal
agriculture.

These Pacific coast and Andean cultures left an incredible amount of
material culture (much of it well-preserved because of the dry climate)
for archeologists to analyze. Their work shows that parts of the
Classical Andes---modern Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, and
Colombia---possessed the same level of cultural complexity as did China,
Persia, and India during the same period. Through this material culture,
the Classical peoples begin to separate themselves from their ancient
and often less complex ancestors.

While it is tempting to lean heavily on artifacts for knowledge of the
period, there is a danger of overreliance. For example, pottery of the
Moche culture (see Figure 10.3) is well known for its often quite
graphic images of female fertility and sexuality. These pieces are
important works for archeologists and historians alike, but one must
keep in mind that little is known about how much these representations
of Moche female sexuality in art actually tell us about gender
relationships in their society.

This section begins with the end of the Archaic Period and the rise of a
group of civilizations referred to as the **Norte Chico**.

### 10.8.1 Norte Chico {.import-Header3}

The Pacific coast developed large ceremonial and residential centers,
which were organized around distinct status and rank among citizens.
This area resembles other "crucible" areas like the Deh Luran Plain of
Iraq, the Nile in Egypt, and the Olmec heartland. While similarities
with the aforementioned early civilizations exist, the Norte Chico
stands out for three reasons. First, it was politically "pristine."
Scholars find no evidence that any outside polity influenced its
development. Second, it endured for more than 1,300 years. This
longevity gave the Norte Chico great influence in what would ultimately
become a distinct Andean civilization. For example, large platform
mounds of Norte Chico would also appear later in the highland center of
**Chavín** **de Huantar**. The final reason Norte Chico stands out from
other early civilizations is its development happened very quickly. By
2800 BCE, there were a number of similar large sites all with
residential complexes, plazas, and platform
mounds.[^\[18\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-18 "Jonathan Haas and Winifred Creamer, “Crucible of Andean Civilization: The Peruvian Coast from 3000 to 1800 BC” Current Anthropology 47:5: October 2006, 746."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-18
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 18"}

The **Aspero** site is the archetype of these large sites. It covers
fifteen hectares and contains six platform mounds. While there are a
number of large sites like Aspero, there doesn't seem to have been a
central Norte Chico chiefdom or state. There was no Norte Chico capital
and no real evidence of conflict or warfare. This absence of conflict
may be connected with the fact that scholars find no indication of
differentially-distributed sumptuary goods, such as jewelry, clothing,
and exotic trade materials, in Norte Chico. Even shell beads and stone
are extremely rare to find in these sites so near to the Pacific.

Usually, a cultural area requires some centralization and large-scale
agriculture before scholars refer to it as a civilization. The Norte
Chico earns that distinction, however, because the level of cultural
complexity indicates that they at least tried to centralize. In the
Norte Chico, there occurred episodic attempts at non-egalitarianism
which were eventually abandoned. Many scholars also argue that Norte
Chico did in fact become sophisticated and sedentary, not through
agriculture but through fishing; this argument is known as the maritime
theory. While unique, the maritime theory has trouble supporting the
idea that the Norte Chico advanced merely through fishing, as
insufficient archeological evidence of communal labor sites centered on
fishing exists to support it. Instead, a more likely explanation of
Norte Chico complexity involves agriculture and fishing meeting at the
middle, in a "shared labor" theory. A number of coastal sites contain
not only remnants of cotton fishing nets but other inland products like
avocados and corn as well. These remnants mean that the canal building
that took place between 4,000 and 3,000 BCE in the interior was likely
only possible with the assistance of the coast's more plentiful labor
force. This assistance was paid for with cotton nets and other
agricultural products that in turn helped the coastal population feed
itself and grow year after year.

A larger temporary labor force would produce more canals and aqueducts,
a cycle that explains much of Norte Chico's economic expansion. Some of
this cooperation may have taken the form of pilgrimages to Norte Chico
sites and the construction of monuments within Aspero, Caral, and other
sites to commemorate them. The dry season of July and August presented a
lull that would have been a good time for such pilgrimages. Evidence of
communal cooking and eating exists, along with that of communal
building.

### 10.8.2 Chavín de Huantar {.import-Header3}

While the Norte Chico is the oldest identifiable civilization along the
Pacific coast, Chavín de Huantar has also captured much attention as a
crucible site for Andean culture. **Chavín** **de Huantar** is the
iconic representation of the Late Initial Period (1800--800 BCE), where
Peru saw the beginnings of a mix of Andean, coastal, and Amazon
cultures. Chavín is located at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters in
the Callejon de Conchucos, the easternmost basin between the Cordilleras
Negra and Blanca in the Peruvian Andes. It is also midway between the
coast and jungle, giving it access to the culture and resources of the
greater Andean region. This access made it a pilgrimage center, an
importer of luxury goods, and a disseminator first unifying Andean
style[^\[19\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-19 "Rebecca R. Stone, Art of the Andes: From Chavin to Inca: 3rd ed. (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2012)."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-19
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 19"}. Chavín's "Old Temple" is 330 feet
across the back and more than fifty feet high at its highest. The temple
is U-shaped with a sunken court in the middle, and harpy eagle, jaguar,
and parading shamans surround it. The temple is also built around the
*lanzón* (great lance) which was a kind of supernatural conduit. The
lanzón is similar in style to the Tello Obelisk which was found in a
corner of the Old Temple courtyard. The obelisk contains carvings on all
of its sides, carvings which primarily represent tropical and mythical
origins or "gifts of the
cayman."[^\[20\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-20 "Ibid."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-20
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 20"} Many dualities appear on the
obelisk: male-female, plant type, ecological zone, sky-water, life and
death, etc. These dualities and their meaning were reinforced by the
pilgrimages made to Chavín and the ceremonies contained within them. It
seems that Chavín architects used all of the symbolic value of the site
available to them. The mixed human-animal features of the sculptures,
the ingestion of hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus, and acoustic symbolism
were all important parts of the pilgrimages. Archaeologists have found
marine shell trumpets in the tunnel complex under the city and have
attempted to replicate how sound would contribute to the mind-altering
rituals undertaken at the
complex.[^\[21\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-21 "Ibid."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-21

The images and rituals at this site help establish what scholars refer
to as the "Chavín
cult."[^\[22\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-22 "Ibid."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-22
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 22"} The Chavín cult presents a
universalist message based on the combined elements of coast and
highlands that helped bring people to sites like this for ceremony and
construction. In other words, these ideas helped move the Andes into the
state phase. At Chavín, it also seems that there was a leader/priest,
like in Egypt. It was, therefore, through spiritual power that the state
congealed and
grew.[^\[23\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-23 "Ibid."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-23

### 10.8.3 Moche {.import-Header3}

Chavín de Huantar was not a developed civilization, but it did help
create the importance of religion and ceremonial life in the Andes, both
in everyday practice and in sacred sites. Later, other groups in Peru,
groups like the **Moche**, would build on religion and ceremony to help
with state formation. The Moche began to conquer the north coast valleys
in 200 BCE and, by 250 CE, had begun to construct the **Huaca del Sol**,
or temple of the sun, and the **Huaca de la Luna**, or temple of the
moon, at their capital, which bore the same name. The Huaca del Sol
seems to have been a royal residence, and the Huaca de la Luna a place
of worship. The Huaca del Sol contained over 143 million bricks,
arranged into columns and marked with symbols perhaps of who made
them.[^\[24\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-24 "Adams, 106."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-24
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 24"} Each column probably represented a
tax-paying **Ayllu** (kinship-based community), meaning that the Huaca
or temple was a literal representation of how the empire was held up by
its individual units. There is still some debate about how much
centralization there was at the upper echelons of Moche politics, but
there was undoubtedly a leadership class with several administrative
levels. The first administrative level was that of the divine kings who
are depicted in murals and ceramics from this period. The second was of
noble administrators. Below that were bureaucrats who organized the
already extant clan system. Below them were the long-standing clan
leaders. The lowest level was composed of commoners, many of whom lived
in single-story adobe houses. Most commoners mastered some craft like
metallurgy or weaving. Others were highly skilled and perhaps worked
exclusively for the rulers.

Residents living outside of the capital were almost exclusively farmers
who lived along the Moche's extensive irrigation canals. The Moche found
a very practical application of the previously mentioned
coastal-mountain symbiosis through the llama. The llama is a
domesticated mountain pack animal that the Moche used to journey to the
coast and gather guano at the Chincha Islands for fertilizing their
valley farms.

<figcaption>Figure 10.3 | Stirrup-spout vessel, Peru north coast, Moche
culture, 100–500 CE Author: Unknown Source: Wikimedia Commons License:

</figure>

By 600 CE, the city of the Moche covered an area of a square kilometer
and probably had a population of 15,000. Each conquered valley outside
of the capital had its own huaca, and each one was connected to Moche by
relay runners who carried messages written in the form of lines and dots
on Lima beans.

Perhaps the most notable Moche legacy was their art. Their buildings,
their murals, and their pottery alike reflected their great skill and
the high level of societal stratification. The Huaca del Sol at Cerro
Blanco, for example, contained millions of bricks and more than 100
types of geometric symbols. Moche murals contained a unique series of
squares depicting both abstract and mythological concepts involving
themes of creation, combat, sacrifice, and men-jaguars. As already
mentioned, this sacrifice may not have always been violent, may not have
been literal, and always has a functional explanation. In this case,
sacrifice is designed to terrify or, at the very least, impress a
subject population.

### 10.8.4 Huari {.import-Header3}

While the Moche were notable because of their art and material culture,
their use of violence to achieve and hold power threatens to cloud our
image of the north coast peoples. The **Huari**, on the other hand, were
able to build a successful empire in nearby areas combining intimidation
and militarism with diplomacy, trade, and ideology. The Huari ruled over
more territory than any previous Andean polity, partially by absorbing
neighboring groups through taxation, distribution of goods, feasting,
and religious ceremonies. There is also evidence that the Huari used
sacred mummy bundles or trophy heads to incorporate outgroups and
maintain a ritual relationship with these outgroups. Huari textiles and
ceramics were found far from the capital, and Huari architecture was
highly influential throughout the
region.[^\[25\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-25 "Tiffany Tung, Violence, Ritual, and the Wari Empire: Bioarchaeological Interpretations of the Human Past: Local, Regional, and Global Perspectives (Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 2012), 24-25."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-25
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 25"} The Huari Empire carved out a
centralized state in a region where none had previously existed by
coordinating local irrigation and labor systems. By 700 CE, Huari
maintained a population of 25,000 and an over 700-kilometer-wide "zone
of influence" connected by a road network that may have been the model
for the Inca road system. In fact, it was ultimately Huari diplomacy and
organization, rather than Moche violence in ritual killings, that
provided a more useful precedent for the
Inca.[^\[26\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-26 "Adams, 113."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-26

### 10.8.5 Chimu {.import-Header3}

The **Chimu Kingdom** was perhaps influenced more directly by remnants
of the Moche, occupying more or less the same geographic area. The Chimu
capital of **Chan** **Chan** was established at about 1000 CE. Through
their system of split inheritance, the Chimu forced the newly-ascended
ruler to build his own material wealth. This expectation meant conquest
of new territory and an increase in taxes. It also meant the
construction of a new palace where each ruler would be buried, along
with hundreds of his attendants and llamas who were sacrificed to
accompany him in the afterlife. A Chimu ruler was also buried with a
sample of the wealth he had accumulated in his lifetime in the form of
textiles, wood carvings, pottery, or jewelry. While earthquakes meant
that the Chimu had to work hard to reclaim or make any use at all of
Moche irrigation canals, they did manage to revive and extend the Moche
system to eventually provide Chan Chan with diverse agricultural
products from maize to cotton to peanuts. The Chimu also employed
violence in their rise to power; however, their conquest by the Inca cut
short any means for scholars to see if they intended to follow or rather
eventually break from the Moche
legacy.[^\[27\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-27 "Adams, 114-116."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-27
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 27"}

10.8.6 South Coast peoples

The south coast of Peru developed somewhat distinctly because it is
extremely arid. In certain areas along the coast, there has never been
recorded rain. Surviving there meant accessing and controlling Andean
runoff that sometimes went underground. As a result, the south coast's
population was much smaller but in many ways was culturally richer.

The **Nazca** carved out their civilization along the south coast
between 100 BCE and 600 CE. There was a large center at Cahuachi as
early as 200 BCE, but it was largely ceremonial rather than residential.
Forty huacas were also built in the areas surrounding Cahuachi but also
were without large permanent populations. The Nazca maintained a regular
pilgrimage to Cahuachi involving music, feasts, and fertility rites.
There was some captive sacrifice, but it is not clear of whom. Nazca
leadership was probably a confederacy of clans, making the forty huacas
the hubs of political and sacred activities. Huacas are further
explained in section 10.8.8.

</figure>

The Nazca are well known for their pottery and textiles. Their pottery
depicted mythical feline or otter figures, many of which were associated
with water and fertility---in this climate, water essentially is
fertility. The same figures are represented on the Nazca lines/geoglyphs
that were created by clearing the desert floor of stone and leaving the
motifs. The straight lines were probably "ritual walkways." Others argue
that the Nazca Lines were an astronomical calendar centered around the
agricultural cycle. Overall, the Nazca had an impressive but brief
florescence which came to an abrupt end after a prolonged drought in the
550s
CE.[^\[28\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-28 "Adams, 109."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-28

### 10.8.7 Tiwanaku {.import-Header3}

**Tiwanaku** was a ceremonial center and administrative city near Lake
Titicaca established in the fifth century CE. At its height, more than
40,000 people lived in the city itself; they were supported by a
population of 365,000 in the subjected outskirts. The surrounding
farmlands produced high crop yields with abundant quinoa and potatoes
supported by meat and legumes. They used canals, ridged fields, and
raised fields, and they even created a series of ditches that created
fog and prevented frost in the colder months.

</figure>

In the city itself, several large platform mounds connected by causeways
were used by the administrators of this complex system. From subordinate
colonies hundreds of miles away, they received corn, coca, tropical
birds, and medicinal herbs. Many of these goods were carried by llamas.
Alpacas also provided high-grade wool for textiles.

Tiwanaku contained many ethnic and linguistic zones and "vertically
integrated" many areas of the Andes for the first time. Tiwanaku was
relatively stable until its downfall around 1,000 CE. Saline deposits
from long-term irrigation may have reduced the fertility of the soil,
leaving Tiwanaku without its most distinct advantage.

In general, comparing these three more recent civilizations to the first
civilizations of Norte Chico reveals increased complexity in all cases
with class structure developing, warfare, and religion, even though
their methods of survival were quite different.

### 10.8.8 The Inca {.import-Header3}

The Huari and Tiwanaku built on local resources to construct their
states. While the Inca are the best known of these Andean civilizations,
they began in the same way by building on the Ayllu kinship system.

In some ways, the Ayllu system was quite suitable for an empire.
**Ayllus** were networks of families and individuals who traded in labor
and subsistence and ritual
activities.[^\[29\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-29 "Michael A. Malpass, Daily Life in the Inca Empire, 2nd ed. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2009), 32."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-29
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 29"} This system meant built-in labor
obligations existed, as did rules about marriage and ancestor worship.
All of these rules were reinforced through ritual, allowing the Inca to
build upon Ayllu rituals to increase their power, authority, and divine
claim to the throne. Future Incas were only eligible to rule if they
descended from the Royal Allyu.

After the Inca had established their legitimacy, their expansion would
begin during the reign of **Pachacuti**. By the time of his death in
1471, he conquered not only the Chanca and Quechua ethnicities of the
southern Andes but also the coastal Chimu. The Inca used **Cuzco** as
their imperial capital, expanding it around several huacas into the
shape of a puma. They also built the Sun Temple in honor of the god
Inti, who was all-powerful and benevolent and from whom Inca rulers
claimed to descend.

Not only did the Ayllu help the empire take shape, but it also became
its main administrative units once it had expanded. Local Ayllu nobility
reinforced their connection to the empire through the mummification and
consecration of ancestors. Mummies or other sacred bundles would become
"huacas," venerated in Cusco by Inca nobility to establish a sacred
connection between local Ayllus and the empire. (See map for the
connections between Cuzco and surrounding areas.) Labor obligations were
the primary form of taxation organized through the Ayllu and closely
recorded on quipus. Through Ayllu labor, the Inca collected taxes,
stored and distributed food, and built their road system. The Inca road
system eventually covered over 5,500 kilometers, stretching from Ecuador
to Chile. Counting all of the sub-systems, the roads covered brings that
amount closer to thirty-two thousand aggregate kilometers. The roads
varied in sophistication and width, depending on conditions and need,
but could include staircases, causeways, and suspension bridges. This
complexity had added elements of efficiency through the Inca network of
messengers that would operate twenty-four hours a day and carry a
message from one location in the empire to another in a matter of a few
days.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 636px">

<figcaption>Map 10.6 | Map of the Four Suyus of the Inca Empire Author:

3.0</figcaption>
</figure>

The Inca also used religion extensively to keep their empire strong.
Each Ayllu had a huaca connected to it with multiple meanings, including
as an origin point. The sun, on the other hand, was the royal
progenitor, and the temple **Coricancha** located in Cuzco was the most
important temple to the sun. From Coricancha radiated forty-one sacred
lines or ceques connected to 328 huacas in the Cuzco valley. Many huacas
were connected to water or rain, giving a sacred importance to some
drains, fountains, baths, and libations.

An empire of this size would not have been possible without an effective
army. Incan weapons reflected the landscape. Their armor was light, they
used lots of projectiles, and they protected their fortresses with
boulders that could be rolled down hills. All these defenses used the
advantages the mountains offered. Some archers were even recruited from
the Amazon. Their strength was in their combination of mobility and
superior numbers. There was very little siege tradition; battles would
commence as soon as the armies arrived.

All empires would collect taxes, have armies, and build temples. The
Inca were so successful, it seems, because they considered the most
fundamental elements of Andean culture to strengthen their hold on
power. Pre-Inca Andean society was a uniquely paralleled one in which
both men and women contributed to Andean religious, economic, and
political life. In forming their empire, the Inca were very cognizant of
Andean understanding of gender. To garner the support of the female
sphere (some scholars say to undermine it), the Incas *created* a
revered class of *aclla* women; these were attractive girls who would
represent their newly conquered home Ayllu as elites of the glorious
Inca Empire. These "chosen women" not only solidified Inca imperial
bonds through marriage, converting a political entity into a family, but
also expanded Inca religious legitimacy when a chosen few were
periodically sacrificed and converted into the "divine custodians" of
their communities.

### 10.8.9 Machu Picchu {.import-Header3}

Nestled in the Peruvian Andes, **Machu Picchu** is undoubtedly the most
well-known Inca site by modern tourists. The site is located at 8,000
feet above sea level, in a forested area. It is framed by the Urubamba
River and sits on a ridge between two peaks. The site itself must have
been spectacular before construction began, but the complex itself is
nothing short of
extraordinary.[^\[30\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-30 "Ibid., 108-09."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-30

</figure>

Despite its iconic status, much less is known about its
fifteenth-century role. Its construction seems to have been ordered by
Pachacuti, who used it as a royal retreat of sorts from Cuzco. The most
attractive time for travel would have been during the winter, when Machu
Picchu was much warmer than Cuzco. There is evidence of the same skilled
craftspeople and retainers that accompanied the Inca in Cuzco
maintaining a presence in Machu Picchu as well. Machu Picchu did have
tracts of surrounding land to feed the court, the emperor, and visiting
dignitaries and to supply the ceremonies connected with their arrival.
However, this was not a city. Only a few year-round residents inhabited
it, and even at its seasonal height, the population only reached about
750. There are agricultural terraces which grew potatoes and maize and a
spring for bathing and drinking that was connected by aqueducts to a
fountain between the Temple of the Sun and the residences. There are one
hundred and seventy-two structures at the site in total, including
residences for the Inca's elite retinue and smaller dwellings for the
servants. Also, thirty buildings are dedicated to ceremonial purposes,
including the Temple of the Three Windows; the Intihuatana, an oblong
rock at the head of a large staircase; and The Temple of the Condor. The
construction is not only visually impressive, but also structural
engineers have remarked at its sophisticated drainage and foundation
work that have allowed it to stand mostly intact for more than 500
years.[^\[31\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-31 "Ibid., 112-114."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-31

## 10.9 NORTH AMERICA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

While most evidence points to human migration through North America to
South America, the hallmarks of civilization would arrive later in what
are now the United States and Canada. Many of us refer to the areas
connected by Panama simply as "The Americas," but the Panamanian land
bridge first linked the two continents only two million years ago. This
was prior to human arrival in the Americas, but this separate
development meant that North and South American flora and fauna
experienced millions of years of separate development and evolution.
This distinct development would influence the pace and patterns of human
settlement in the Americas a great deal.

### 10.9.1 The West {.import-Header3}

The arrival of maize, beans, and squash from northern Mexico helped mark
the transition to sedentary culture in the Southwest of what is now the
United States. There is some evidence of primitive maize dating back to
the middle of the second millennium BCE, but it would not become
widespread until about 1000 BCE. A newer, drastically different maize,
"**Maiz** **de** **Ocho**," is believed to have been the key to the
flourishing of sedentary villages across the Southwest and to the
eventual appearance of large pithouse villages around 500 BCE. **Maiz**
**de** **Ocho** is better suited to arid conditions and yields larger
kernels which are more easily milled. **Pithouses**, dwellings whose
name indicates that its walls were in fact the sides of an excavated
pit, became widespread across the Southwest because they were "thermally
efficient." They lost less heat than aboveground structures in winter
and, as they were built into the ground, were cooler in the summer.
Pithouses remained in wide use in the area until about 700 CE, when more
complex exchange networks and social organization led to more diverse
settlement
patterns.[^\[32\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-32 "Brian M. Fagan, Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent, 3rd ed. (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2000), 306."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-32
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 32"}

One of these new settlement patterns was the "great pueblo" that
appeared as part of the "**Chaco Phenomenon**" around 900 CE. To deal
with unpredictable summer rainfall, the Chaco Anasazi people of New
Mexico built three "great houses"---Peñasco Blanco, Pueblo Bonito, and
Una Vida, a large structure situated at natural drainage junctions. The
semi-circular town of Pueblo Bonito grew out of a pithouse village to
eventually form a semi-circular network of more than 600 rooms and
reached a height of five stories along the canyon's rear wall. The
complex's walls were built of sandstone blocks whose surfaces and cracks
were smoothed and shored up by a clay-sand mortar. Construction of the
high ceilings also involved complicated ashlar masonry patterns that
could be covered with "adobe plaster or

Each of the larger **Chaco Canyon** sites also had at least one great
kiva. Kivas were subterranean gathering places which were used by
individual kin groups for work, for education, and for ceremonies.
Larger kivas were gathering places for more formal ceremonies where
political decisions affecting the entire community were often made.

By 1050 CE, five great pueblos in Chaco Canyon supported a total
population of around 5,000 people. While most lived within the
relatively compact canyon area, the influence of this populace reached
well beyond the immediate pueblo complex. Evidence indicates that the
Chaco Canyon people may have had exclusive access to sources of
turquoise all over New Mexico and used the stone in their workshops
where they produced vases, human effigy vessels, incense burners, bells,
trumpets, and painted tables. By the early twelfth century, Chaco
Canyon's influence extended to much of northwest New Mexico and southern
Colorado, where more than seventy outlying sites contained kivas, Chaco
pottery, and similar architecture to what was found in Pueblo Bonito.
The Chaco also developed a road system that may have been for the
distribution of resources or pilgrimages. The road construction involved
considerable cooperation to craft, at different stages, stairways and
ramps carved out of bedrock and other pathways lined with boulders.
After 1130 CE, drought and growing population densities led to a
100-year decline of the Chaco sites. By the 1200s, most of the pueblos
of the Chaco system were empty, their population dispersed and away from
the
canyon.[^\[34\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-34 "Ibid., 323-329."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-34

village life, they continued to thrive culturally and are recognized as
the precursors of the modern Pueblo peoples.

### 10.9.2 The Pacific Coast {.import-Header3}

Further west, cultures along North America's Pacific coast were also
sedentary but did not derive their existence from farming. Instead,
multiple Pacific coast cultures took advantage of abundant ocean
resources, such as various fish species, sea mammals, timber, shellfish,
waterfowl, game, and wild plants. The abundance of these resources often
suggests that coastal cultures were less complex than their
contemporaries in the interior, but the ravages of climate required
tremendous adaptation over time. During the Late Holocene period alone,
from 2000 BCE to the present, periodic colder episodes may have led to
consequences as disparate as lakeside flooding, lowering of tree lines,
drought, and a reduction of available marsh areas. Northwestern coastal
peoples, for example, addressed this volatility by never putting their
eggs in one basket. While they may have primarily eaten acorns or
salmon, they made sure to always maintain a secondary food source.
Further south, the **Chumash**, a people inhabiting the central and
southern California coast, developed ceremonial centers, provinces
incorporating several villages, sophisticated "watercraft," and vibrant
trade with the interior. In fact, this trade helped the Chumash avoid
scarcities as
well.[^\[35\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-35 "Ibid., 222, 248."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-35
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 35"}

### 10.9.3 The Plains {.import-Header3}

The Great Plains represented perhaps the largest area of pre-Columbian
North America, but it is also one of the least understood. The Wild West
shows of the nineteenth century produced the lasting yet erroneous
impression that the Plains Indian culture remained unchanged for
centuries. Big game hunters in the Clovis Culture first inhabited the
area as early as 13,000 years ago. As big game became extinct around
9000 BCE, Paleo-Indian groups on the plains turned to foraging and
fishing in river valleys and to hunting of primarily bison as well as
deer and fowl. By 9000 BCE, the Ice Age had left behind a vast expanse
of "arid grassland" from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico, an expanse known
as the "**Great Bison Belt**." Long before European explorers introduced
horses, people on the Great Plains had developed sophisticated processes
of hunting bison on foot that involved some hunters disguised as bison,
others orchestrating movements among hunting groups, and others shouting
to drive the bison toward pre-selected "traps" or "jumps." Dozens of
bison would fall over a precipice to their deaths. By 6000 BCE, plains
hunters had more sophisticated projectiles that could penetrate the skin
of a surrounded animal or one that had become stuck in mud or sand.
Findings at the Olsen-Chubbock site in Colorado indicate that by 6500
BCE, Paleo-Indians had also begun to butcher seventy-five percent of the
animals they killed, which could sustain a group of 100 people for more
than a
month.[^\[36\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-36 "Ibid., 93-96."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-36
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 36"} Early Plains Archaic (5600--3000
BCE) activity, while still largely dependent on bison, shows some
increasing reliance on fish, fowl, and berries, possibly indicating
warmer and drier conditions that "diminished grass cover throughout the
Central Plains." Middle Plains Archaic peoples (2900 BCE to 1000 BCE)
adapted their bison hunting to allow for a more sedentary existence,
returning to the same hunting ground year after year and making much of
the bison meat into pemmican (a brick of pounded flesh and fat) that
could be stored for seasons when bison were less plentiful (Fagan 123).
By 550 CE, the Late Plains Archaic people had fully incorporated the bow
and arrow into their hunts, which tended to be less frequent but more
productive, often incorporating "mass kill sites" that were used for
hundreds of years in some
cases.[^\[37\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-37 "Ibid., 122-127."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-37

### 10.9.4 The Eastern Woodlands {.import-Header3}

The term 'Middle Woodland' is occasionally used to refer to the period
between 200 BCE and CE 400; this coincided with the influence of the
**Hopewell** culture over much of eastern North America. Previous to the
Hopewell ascendance, the Adena people built hundreds of burial mounds in
and around central Ohio (2300--2100 BCE). Accompanying the burials were
dozens of types of grave goods, including spear points, stone pipes, and
sculptures of animals and human hands. Hopewell mound building
(1000--200 BCE) and culture as a whole certainly had antecedents in the
Adena and early Woodland cultures as a whole, but the Hopewell tradition
stands out in its grandiosity. With their center in the Ohio Valley, the
Hopewell created hundreds of hectares of earthworks with regionally
specific styles of craftsmanship. Copper, shells, obsidian, and shark
and alligator teeth were all used to create personal adornments,
containers, pipes, and figurines. Much of this artifact diversity can be
attributed to the size and vitality of the Hopewell exchange zone which
extended across much of eastern North America from Florida to the Great
Lakes. While there is evidence that areas as far away as North Dakota
participated in this exchange network, the so-called "core areas" were
in the Mississippi, Illinois, Scioto, and Miami river valleys in
Illinois and Ohio. As trade picked up, so did the ceremonial and
political significance of the artifacts received by local leaders and
ultimately included in burial mounds. Some artifacts were buried with
their owners at death as symbols of their power in life. The expansion
of ceremony through these objects also meant that many of the
Hopewellian centers shared physical characteristics such as both
platform and conical mounds, structures for cremation, and burial
vaults. The local populations who participated in these ceremonies seem
to have lived near, but not in, the ceremonial centers themselves in
single- or multiple-family households. Although close to other
residents, Hopewell communities were scattered across the area,
subsisting through a mix of foraging and
horticulture.[^\[38\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-38 "Ibid., 417-422."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-38
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 38"}

### 10.9.5 Cahokia {.import-Header3}

Other North American mound builders established their center at
**Cahokia**, across the Mississippi River from present-day Saint Louis.
Cahokia was inhabited from about 700 to 1400 CE. At its peak, the city
covered nearly six square miles, and 10,000 to 20,000 people lived
there. Over 120 mounds were built over time, and most of the mounds were
enlarged several times. Houses were arranged in rows and around open
plazas, and agricultural fields were cultivated nearby. Other mound
centers and communities were located in the contiguous "American Bottom"
region. The beginning of the Mississippian period began around 1050 CE,
and the transition to the Moorehead Phase---marked by decreasing mound
building---happened about
1200.[^\[39\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-39 "Mary Beth D. Trubitt, “Mound Building and Prestige Goods Exchange: Changing Strategies in the Cahokia Chiefdom,” American Antiquity 65:4 (Oct., 2000): 669-690."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-39
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 39"}

What scholars still don't know about Cahokia is why there was decreased
mound building after 1200, during the so-called Moorehead Phase. While
scholars usually associate decreased construction with societal decline,
recent scholarship suggests that the opposite may be true for Cahokia.
Instead of declining, Cahokia might have gone through a transition to a
lesser focus on staples and storage and greater focus toward prestige
goods and economic power. Their decreased mound building may have
coincided with their energy being more focused on controlling trade
across the Mississippian Southeast. Scholars see evidence of this shift
with an increase in nonlocal raw materials and "prestige goods" at
Cahokia during this period, such materials and goods as minerals,
igneous rock for ax heads, ceramics, marine shell, quartz crystal, and
copper.[^\[40\]^](#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_footnote-608-40 "Ibid."){#chapter-010-slug-608.xhtml_return-footnote-608-40
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 40"}

### 10.9.6 The Arctic {.import-Header3}

The Arctic's harsh climate meant that it was one of the last areas in
the Americas to be permanently settled. The first Paleo-Eskimo
populations appeared around 4,000 years ago emanating from Eastern
Siberia. They were left behind by the original American colonists. The
Arctic colonists expanded rapidly across Alaska, through Canada, and
into Greenland as they all possessed arctic small tool kits including
the important toggle-headed harpoons to kill walrus and seal. In
general, their evolution was from reindeer hunters to seal hunters, but
both types of societies continued to exist side by side.

## 10.10 CONCLUSION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Humans migrated to the Americas by 15,000 BCE and perhaps as many as
3,000 years before. The earliest recognizable civilizations in the
Americas were in Mesoamerica and began during the Archaic Period, ten
thousand years ago. Farmers in Mesoamerica began to cultivate crops such
as corn, squash, beans, chilies, manioc, and sweet potatoes. During
Mesoamerica's more recent Formative Period, the rise of the Olmec
Civilization occurred. They would be followed by several others, most
notably the Maya, and further to the north the **Aztec Empire** that was
at its height when the Spanish arrived in 1519.

Around 3,000 BCE, small campsites and fishing villages began to appear
in Peru. These were eventually replaced by more permanent structures and
agriculture communities which would be the antecedents to the incredibly
complex cultures of the Classical Andes in Peru, Chile, Ecuador,
Bolivia, and Colombia. Among these Pacific coast cultures were the
Moche, the Huari, the Chimu, and the Nazca. Many of these cultures had
their political and cultural centers in large urban areas like Tiwanaku,
which had a population of about 40,000 people around 100 CE. More than
1,000 years later, it was the Inca Empire that would build on these
cultural traditions, extending its rule over more than 5,000 kilometers
from Ecuador to Chile.

Sedentary culture first began in North America when people in the desert
southwest of the continent began to cultivate maize about three thousand
years ago. Groups like the Chaco Anasazi in New Mexico would eventually
construct massive complexes of aqueducts, homes, and ceremonial spaces
by about 1000 CE. There were other major cultural areas all over North
America, from Florida to the frigid Arctic.

Despite (or perhaps because of) their late arrival in the Americas,
humans developed at an incredible pace all across the region. The
residents of the Americas developed remarkable political sophistication,
infrastructure, religion, art, economic integration, and technology that
Europeans marveled at when they arrived in the late fifteenth century.

The year was 1216 CE, and a detachment of Mongols campaigned westward
out of Mongolia and into Central Asia. They were in aggressive pursuit
of the leader of the neighboring Naiman tribe, a certain Küchlüg, who
had the misfortune of allying with Jamukha, the principle rival of
Genghis Khan. The khan had quickly dispatched with their combined
armies, forcing Küchlüg to seek refuge among the Qara Khitai, located to
the southwest. In the intervening years, Küchlüg somehow managed to
usurp the Qara Khitai throne. Not long thereafter, he attacked a Karluk
tribal confederacy that appealed to Genghis Khan for protection. The
Mongol leader deployed 30,000 troops to track down this troublesome
renegade. By 1218, the inveterate adventurer had fled south towards the
Pamir Mountains in modern-day Afghanistan. Eventually, the Mongol
general Jebe, along with the help of some local hunters, caught up with
Küchlüg and executed him. And yet it was the pursuit of the fugitive
Küchlüg that inadvertently brought the Mongols into Central Asia. Their
conquest of the region was one without the forethought of empire, yet
the area absorbed, adopted, and integrated the Mongols, just as it had
incorporated external forces many times before. Central Asia displayed a
remarkable ability to embrace foreign influences, such as the Turkic
migrations, expansion of Islam, and Mongol conquest, internalizing them
and making them its own. Situated at the crossroads of many empires,
Central Asia was tucked in between the Chinese, Europeans, Arabs, and
Indians. There, in the middle of these grand civilizations, just along
the Great **Silk Road**, the region connected Asia to the West and
linked it to major patterns in world history. It was from there that
these external forces saturated the area and shaped the course of its
history.

## 11.5 GEOGRAPHY OF CENTRAL ASIA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Unlike many other regions of the world, Central Asia lacks the distinct
topographical features necessary to delineate boundaries. There are
several broad geographical zones in Central Asia nonetheless. Perhaps
the most well-known topographic area in Central Asia is the Great
Eurasian Steppe, a latitudinal belt of grassland that stretches from
Eastern Europe through Mongolia. It was there that nomadic horse
cultures flourished. Located to the south of the steppe was the core of
Central Asia, an area known as Transoxiana. This is a dry region that
lies beyond the Oxus River, known today as the Amu Darya. In
Transoxiana, trade settlements and irrigated agriculture developed along
the Amu Darya and Syr Darya watersheds. Finally, located to the far
south lies the mountainous area of Khorasan, the cultural capital of
Persia prior to the appearance of the Mongols.

## 11.6 TURKIC MIGRATIONS {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Nomadic migration was the first major external influence that would be
integrated into the culture of the region, as steppe peoples imparted a
lasting impression to Central Asia. Beginning with the **Xiongnu** (209
BCE--93 CE), a long-term exodus of steppe peoples spread out of Mongolia
and into Central Asia. For millennia prior to the rise of Genghis Khan,
the winners of the tribal battles for predominance on the **Orkhon
Steppe**, prime pastureland located in western Mongolia, forced the
vanquished off to the west. These periodic mass departures of Turkic
tribes out of the area progressed southwest into Central Asia in a
migration of conquest, not a forced labor diaspora, as happened to
Africans during the slave trade. These new arrivals forever altered the
ethnic makeup of Central Asia. Previously, the region had been
predominantly Persian and Indo-European; when the waves of Turkic tribes
penetrated into the area, though, they occupied the great steppe and
agricultural basin of Central Asia and pushed these Persian groups to
the fringes. Over time, they slowly Turkified the area, endowing it with
a more nomadic character.

These Turkic tribesmen divided their society into five strata. Members
of the royal tribal clan presided over the social order. Positioned
below them were their allies and associated tribes. Next were the common
herders who did not participate in struggles for power. Lower still were
the artisans, such as blacksmiths and leatherworkers. And finally, we
find slaves at the bottom of the hierarchy. They usually acquired their
lowly position in society by means of capture in times of war.

</figure>

These Turkic wanderers belonged to an unstable confederation of clans
and tribes roaming the steppe, loosely bound under a **khagan**, a
charismatic monarch who laid claim to some sort of divine providence.
Khagan made use of their personal charisma, as well as their political
and military smarts, in order to maintain group cohesion and ward off
challenges to their authority. Under strong khagans, tribal
confederations were capable of wielding incredible power, but more often
than not, they were notoriously volatile and often imploded upon the
death of their leader, collapsing into a brutal struggle for power. The
winners in this struggle forced the losers out of the area, and while
many went to the north or south, most went to the west. Victorious
tribes remained in Mongolia on the highly-prized **Orkhon Steppe**,
located near Lake Baikal.

Although the khaganate was a diarchy, or system of dual rule, with the
oldest son controlling half of the land with his father, it lacked a
clear transition of power, like hereditary succession. Because the
khagan theoretically ruled over a series of tribal confederations, any
member of the tribal confederation could ascend to the position of
monarch by demonstrating their personal charisma and martial skills on
the battlefield. This often resulted in a fight to prove oneself that
could erupt into broader inter-tribal strife.

Periodic Turkic migrations into Central Asia transformed the sedentary
culture of the region. These steppe peoples lived by practicing
**pastoral nomadism**, a way of life centered around herding that most
likely predated the Turks but was eventually adopted by them. Their
culture was utilitarian in nature and provided all the necessities for
life on the great plains of Central Asia, including food, clothing,
shelter, and transportation. In order to maintain their pastures, these
horsemen followed a fixed, seasonal pattern of migration because they
did not want their flocks to overgraze. During the winter, for instance,
they camped in foothills and mountain valleys, where it was warmer at
lower altitudes. There they built fixed shelters with one main
objective: survival. The oral tradition, which included songs, epic
narratives, and parables, flourished during the inhospitable winter
months. In the spring, the nomads made a ten-day trip to the prairieland
to graze their herds on fresh grass that just emerged from mountain
runoff. There the women and children erected a central camp, usually
comprising four yurts (round tents), while the men divided the flocks
into their specific pastures. They established about ten satellite camps
around the central camp, with each herd positioned about ten to twenty
miles from the center. This separation of camps minimized the potential
threat that their enemies posed to their herds. During the summer, they
traveled to mid-mountain fields, where it was cooler and offered access
to water. Covering about ten miles per day, it took them approximately
fifty days to reach this campground. Finally, in the fall, they returned
to the steppe in order to make provisions for the harsh winter. These
preparations included drying and preserving their meat and taking milk
from their animals.

Enhanced mobility was the key to the survival of pastoral nomads. They
actually spent a good portion of their lives on horseback and were
accustomed to moving over long distances, taking all of life's
necessities with them. This allowed them to retreat quickly from rival
attacks or areas afflicted by natural disaster. Though their way of life
appeared seemingly innocuous, it enhanced the ability of these horsemen
to expand rapidly and conquer neighboring groups. Additionally, the
annual **Great Hunt** served as a military proving ground that helped
them hone their fighting skills. In preparation for winter, tribes
deployed groups of mounted men, who dispersed in different directions,
with the intent of driving every animal within a set perimeter inwards
to converge at a pre-established central point. With great coordination
taking place over vast distances, these migrants learned how to
coordinate their movements based on a color scheme of arrows and
whistling patterns. Their herding tactics easily translated to military
tactics and proved devastating in combat.

</figure>

Nomad society was certainly capable of waging war. Their ability to
shoot from horseback provided them with a mobile and lethal means to
overcome slower, infantry-based armies. These horsemen carried portable,
three-foot-long **recurve bows** capable of piercing enemy armor from
over 450 meters. Metal enabled a rapid rate of fire without damaging the
archer's fingers. Raised hunting and herding from horseback, nomads even
learned how to sleep in the saddle of the **Mongol Horse**, their
indigenous horse. Though not tall in stature, these sturdy mounts
displayed impressive endurance and allowed groups to traverse great
distances, often up to 160 kilometers per day. The speed with which they
could cover territory on their steeds often confused sedentary forces
and multiplied the terror factor. Native to the region, these horses
were able to forage for themselves and survive on their own. Nomads did
not require supply lines and could, therefore, remain on campaign for an
average of three years. The combination of the skills acquired from
herding, the double-compound bow, and the Mongol Horse translated to a
formula for political domination of Central Asia, at least until the
arrival of Genghis Khan and the Mongols.

Turkic domination of the region began on the battlefield, where the
strategies of steppe warfare proved devastating to infantry-based
armies. The first stage of the **nomad battle strategy** often commenced
with a feigned retreat, in which a group of their cavalry engaged the
adversary, retreated, and encouraged their opponents to follow them.
This technique lengthened the lines of their challengers, as they
pursued the "retreating" Turkic cavalrymen, who were busy shooting
backwards from horseback. The next stage of battle involved outflanking
the enemy and enveloping them. They then showered their foes with
arrows, the objective being to pin the opponent in place. This alone was
often enough to break a sedentary power. When fighting against another
steppe power, their reserves charged the opponent's lines so as to break
their forces into pieces and finish them off piecemeal. Most
importantly, because of their limited numbers, the Turkic horsemen were
reluctant to risk fighting an enemy that they did not believe they could
defeat; instead, they would poison water wells, scorch the earth, and
retreat. The Mongols would later employ similar battle tactics that
allowed them to conquer the whole of Central Asia.

## 11.7 ISLAM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Islam was not the first foreign religion to arrive in Central Asia. In
fact, the region had already been exposed to many foreign systems of
belief prior to the coming of Islam in the seventh century. Local
merchants conducting long-distance trade along the Silk Road came into
contact with many different religious doctrines. Generally, intellectual
diffusion is not a one-way street, as western ideas traveled eastward
and eastern concepts filtered into the west. In this manner, the Silk
Road carried Buddhism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism (an Iranian religion with
both monotheistic and dualist elements), Siberian Shamanism, and even
Nestorian Christianity to Central Asia. The great number of religions
found in the area at the introduction of Islam testified to the great
tolerance of the region. By the tenth century, however, all of the
non-monotheistic faiths had disappeared from Central Asia in the
aftermath of Islamic conquest.

It was **Qutayba** **ibn Muslim** (669--716) who expanded the presence
of Islam in Central Asia during the eighth century, as the general's
forces swept into the area, defeated the Persians, and by 715 CE
completed their conquest of **Transoxiana**, the region located beyond
the Oxus River. A decisive Arab Muslim victory over the Chinese at the
**Battle of Talas River** in 751 secured Central Asia and repulsed the
only major challenge to Islamic rule. The triumph over the Chinese made
it possible for Islam to become entrenched in the region. The Persian
**Samanids** (819--999) made Islam the official state religion and
established a school of theology in Bukhara. But **Islamization** did
not take place overnight; instead, it took centuries. Transoxiana slowly
Islamicized, though it never Arabized. The peoples in the area remained
culturally Turkic and Persian. Central Asia retained its Turkic and
Persian languages, albeit with a heavy Arabic influence in religious
vocabulary.

It took generations for Islam to become fully ingrained in the culture
of Central Asia. Unlike other places, where the religion filtered into
society from the bottom up, as was the case in Southeast Asia,
Islamization in the region occurred from the top down. Local leaders
submitted to the faith in order to maintain their social status and
elite position in society. The conquerors offered the Central Asian
nobility important positions in the administration so long as they
professed Islam, providing the opportunity for the native elite to rule
in their own right.

Islam also displayed a remarkable ability to assimilate the great
varieties of indigenous Central Asian frontier customs as it advanced
through the area, allowing some traditional practices to remain so long
as it accelerated conversion. By accepting certain harmless practices in
order to Islamicize Central Asia, these Muslims mirrored Christian
efforts to Christianize Eastern Europe.

### 11.7.1 Sufism {.import-Header3}

The Islam of Central Asia differed greatly from that which originated in
the Arabian Peninsula. This vast region embraced Islam, remaking it into
a syncretic faith that was culturally its own. Essentially a sort of
mysticism, or folk Islam, **Sufism** in the area emerged from the fusion
of Islamic sedentary civilization and Buddhist nomadic culture. Central
Asians were generally receptive and tolerant of foreign beliefs, but in
order for the faith to take root in the area, missionaries had to make
some concessions to the native, specifically pastoral-nomadic culture.
The urban-dwelling and agricultural populations of the region generally
accepted Sunni Islam and the law of the Sharia; however, the culture and
lifestyle of the itinerant peoples of the steppe did not readily conform
to the rigors of Islamic law. Sufism helped convert these tribes to
Islam, in part due to its doctrinal flexibility. What arose from the mix
of orthodox Islam and Turkic pastoral nomadism was a uniquely Central
Asian brand of Sufism.

In this context, Sufis evangelized to groups on the frontier of Central
Asia. Actually, Sufi merchants were largely responsible for bringing
Islam to the region. Central Asian Sufi orders such as the **Yasaviyah**
established themselves along trade routes in order to reach out to
travelers. These missionaries also proselytized to the Turkic
communities on the steppe. Meanwhile, the **Naqshbandi Order**,
operating in travel lodges, spread Sufism by ministering to Iranian and
Tajik peoples. The followers of these Sufi orders believed that they
could better disseminate a form of the faith that was more loving and
caring.

## 11.8 THE MONGOL ERA {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The Mongols greatly expanded into Central Asia during the thirteenth
century. There they reunited with the Turkic groups who had been
expelled from the Orkhon Steppe over the course of a millennia. The
Mongols confronted many Turkic peoples who had radically altered their
existence since their days on the plains and adopted a stationary way of
life.

At this point in time, forces indigenous to the region shaped the world
around it; foreign influence waned as a consequence of nativism. The
Mongols created the largest land empire in history, as Central Asia
externalized the violence of the steppe, yet it was with enormous
difficulty that they even united as a people. Perhaps the greatest
obstacle for them to overcome was their own divisiveness. Inter-tribal
strife was commonplace, but once they united, the Mongols expanded deep
into Russia, China, India, and the Middle East.

### 11.8.1 A New System for Unity {.import-Header3}

It was **Temujin** (1206--1227), later known as **Genghis Khan**, who
brought this fractured people together and developed a method of
governance and expansion that lasted long after his death. Born into the
aristocratic Borjigin Clan, most likely in 1167, Temujin's success
related to his convictions. Inspired by oral tales of past glory, his
personal charisma and sense of fate enabled him to survive a youth of
life-threatening privation, eventually bringing the various Mongol
tribes together.

With a keen awareness of his own destiny, Temujin was inspired to
achieve greatness. He had a clear vision that he was predestined to
function as a temporal ruler on Earth and exhibited a desire to claim
universal lordship. Through a series of fights, he eventually subjugated
local clans in eastern Mongolia. He then expanded his political control
of the region through a marriage alliance to **Börte** **Üjin**, a
member of the Olkhonut Tribe, which maintained friendly relations with
Temujin's Khiyad Tribe. The Merkit Tribe kidnapped his wife not long
thereafter. Temujin heroically rescued her from this rival tribe, but
she had been held in captivity for eight months and soon gave birth to
their first son Juchi, whose paternity is uncertain.

</figure>

Despite his early successes at empire building, Temujin remained greatly
outnumbered by his opponents and was forced to retreat to the **Heights
of** **Baljuna**, located in modern-day Manchuria, where he convinced
his followers to swear an oath of total allegiance to him and which
called for them to fight for him until death. For their unwavering
loyalty, he promised his supporters a share in his glory upon their
victory. Some Mongol tribes yielded to Temujin by 1204 and agreed to
recognize him as their leader, thus paving the way for a period of final
unification of the Mongols.

Temujin demanded a high level of commitment from his people, endowing
his forces with a coherency and unity of purpose. He also promoted
allies based on merit, rather than by the traditional Mongol method of
advancement based on position within the tribal hierarchy. His
opponents, on the other hand, lacked his force of will and entered into
a series of squabbles. Temujin took advantage of their internal fights,
emerging victorious by 1206. The culmination of his ascendency took
place that year at a Mongol assembly, or **khuriltai**, which appointed
him as the first undisputed universal ruler of the Mongols, or khan.
Uniting them under the authority of his position, Temujin adopted the
name of Genghis Khan.

Genghis Khan presided over peoples who had experienced near-constant
warfare since 1160. Previously, tribal confederations were loose
alliances held together under charismatic khagans and punctuated by
tribal warfare. He consolidated all of these diverse tribes and reshaped
them into a single "nation," endowing Mongol society with more
cohesiveness, a key element to future expansion. He did this by
developing a new political order that deviated from tradition.

Restructuring Mongol society into new administrative military units that
provided the necessary impetus for expansion, Genghis Khan charged each
of his commanders with a tribal unit that was responsible for
controlling a particular pasture and fielding soldiers when needed. His
system had the added effect of assuaging previous conflicts by assigning
the members of one tribe to military detail with other rival tribes,
thus emphasizing collective responsibility. By forcing the men from one
tribe to stand guard over the pastures of other tribes, he weakened
loyalty to ancestral lines and homelands, thereby reinforcing his own
leadership.

Genghis Khan represented the ultimate source of justice in his
newly-formed state, consolidating his position and making it more
authoritarian. By embodying autocracy in the position of the khan, he
made the title of khan institutional, not personal, building a new
foundation for legitimacy. Previously, tribal leadership rested on
charisma. Furthermore, the great khan could not be self-proclaimed but
had to be recognized at a khuriltai.

His law, known as **Yassa**, originated as decrees delivered during war.
Yassa remained secret, which allowed Genghis Khan to adapt it to
changing circumstances. For example, he later incorporated cultural
elements indigenous to Mongol society into the law. He based his code on
shamanist principles, and it served as the social and political formula
binding all Mongols together. It also strengthened Mongol, rather than
clan or tribal, identification. It is believed that Genghis Khan himself
directed the law, while his stepbrother **Shihihutug** served as the
high judge, and his son **Chagatai** administered its execution.

### 11.8.2 Expansion {.import-Header3}

Genghis Khan encouraged Mongol expansion and the conquest of Central
Asia through his somewhat untraditional tactics and policies. After
subduing inter-tribal warfare, he followed tradition and exported the
violence of the steppe. He offered incentives to his soldiers; the
spoils of victory went to those who followed him into battle. Genghis
Khan received ten percent of the loot and divided the remaining ninety
percent between his commanders, who, in turn, distributed their portion
amongst their retinue. This plunder also included the inhabitants of all
subjugated lands, which resulted in the dramatic depopulation of
conquered territory, as the khan received his share of artisans and
craftsmen to be sent back to the itinerant Mongol capital.

In 1208, Genghis Khan targeted northern China for pillaging, but he
quickly encountered considerable difficulties overcoming well-fortified
Chinese municipalities. The Chinese had ringed their principle
metropolises with moats and connected these major urban centers to
several smaller satellite towns via underground tunnels. The Mongols had
attempted to starve these cities into submission, but they lacked the
military technology necessary to overcome walls forty-feet high and
fifty-feet wide. To counter these challenges, they imported the
technology necessary to defeat Chinese cities. Genghis Khan also
compensated for a lack of native talent by incorporating foreign
engineers into their army. He utilized Arab, Persian, and Chinese
experts to solve the problem of defeating Chinese municipalities. Their
knowledge of siege warfare enabled them to construct the siege engines
capable of subjugating cities.

Adding these new sedentary peoples to the khan's army inevitably caused
problems, for these men hailed from distinctly different cultures and
did not interact well with the Mongols. Genghis Khan, therefore,
combined the mobility of his forces with the slow, bulky siege engines
of the sedentary armies. While he kept his cavalry independent from the
foreign engineers, mostly comprised of mercenaries, he blended these two
disparate groups on the battlefield to his strategic advantage.

For the Mongols, building an empire proved much easier than maintaining
one. The nomads possessed an inherent need to loot and plunder cities,
and Genghis Khan took advantage of this innate desire by remaining on
campaign. But the Mongols had difficulty understanding settled
civilization and did not know how to maintain order in that new and
different cultural milieu. Although they were able to instill fear in
their enemies and easily forced many cities to capitulate, the Mongols
co-opted local officials to ensure that taxes and tribute flowed freely
back to their capital.

With his newly-constructed army, Genghis Khan returned to northern China
again in 1210 and began a continuous campaign of destruction, primarily
directed against the **Jin** **Dynasty** (1115--1234), an empire ruled
by a **Jurchen** minority, a Tungusic people from Manchuria who would
later call themselves the Manchu. In an early battle, the Jin put their
Turkic cavalry up front to confront the Mongol horsemen. The Mongols
managed to convince the Jin Dynasty's cavalry to defect to their side.
Genghis Khan subsequently advanced on the Jin capital of Zhongdu and
entered into a prolonged siege. In November of 1211, the khan withdrew
his troops to their winter pastures, only to return again in 1212.
Genghis Khan attempted a rash assault of the city. He failed and was
wounded in the process, thus the Mongols had to retreat once again.

Genghis Khan returned a fourth time in March of 1213, this time with the
goal of conquering Korea, Manchuria, and all of northern China. Early
difficulties campaigning against the Jin Dynasty prompted him to adjust
his strategy. By laying waste to all of northern China, he aimed to
annihilate their way of life, turning the region into vast pastureland
for his herds. The Mongol leader surrounded Zhongdu and starved the
city's inhabitants into submission. He systematically obliterated
everything in order to send a message to the inhabitants that it was
futile to resist him. He even considered taking the city, brick by
brick, and dumping it into the Yellow River. Fortunately for the
residents of Zhongdu, a captured Chinese bureaucrat intervened and
convinced Genghis Khan that it would be better to "sack" them every year
through the collection of tribute. Mongol interest in rebuilding the
city began soon thereafter, as Genghis Khan incorporated northern China
into his state and opened the region to trade. This campaign represented
the first significant addition of territory to the Mongol Empire.

As this chapter began, it was with the tenacious pursuit of the fugitive
**Küchlüg** in 1216 that originally brought the Mongols into Central
Asia. There they aroused the disdain of the local ruler in the area, the
Shah of **Khwarazm,** **Ala al-Din Muhammad II**. Ruling over a loose
confederation of disparate peoples, Ala al-Din Muhammad lacked security
in his position as the Khwarazm Shah. Even his own mother was in
intrigue against him. It was he who provoked the wrath of the Mongols.
It all began when Genghis Khan sent a trade caravan, which probably
included some spies dressed incognito as merchants, to the frontier post
of Otrar, located along the Syr Darya. The shah believed that the trade
mission was a mere deception meant to obscure an eminent invasion.
**Inalchuq**, uncle of Ala al-Din Muhammad and governor of Otrar,
improvidently convinced the Khwarazm Shah to have the entire party
executed. An enraged Genghis Khan quickly dispatched another envoy and
demanded that the governor of the city be put to death and have his head
sent back to Mongolia as proof that Genghis Khan's wishes were
fulfilled. The shah executed this emissary too, a rash decision that
precipitated the Mongol onslaught of Central Asia, which resulted in
brutal massacres and a drastic depopulation of the region.

Ala al-Din Muhammad prudently fled the area, leaving the citizens of
Khwarazmia to defend themselves against the forces of Genghis Khan. A
total of five Mongol armies approached the Khwarazm capital of Samarkand
from different directions, converging in 1220. The Mongols slayed the
inhabitants of the city and constructed pyramid-like edifices out of
their severed skulls. In 1221, they seized the city of Urgench and
dumped it into the Amu Darya, piece by piece, diverting the course of
the waterway. And yet, Khwarazm Shah Ala al-Din Muhammad still
inexplicably escaped capture and absconded south. Genghis Khan deployed
another force of some 30,000 troops under the generals **Jebe** and
**Sübedei** to track him down and put him to death. The shah eventually
sought refuge on an island in Caspian, where he died of pleurisy.

Meanwhile, **Jalal al-Din** **Manguburti**, the son of the Khwarazm
Shah, assembled an army of resistance. Genghis Khan sent his stepbrother
Shihihutug to apprehend Jalal, but he escaped to the Hindu Kush
Mountains of Afghanistan. Jalal's forces managed to defeat the
Shihihutug led Mongols on the field of battle at Parwan in the spring of
1221, a rare loss. The Mongols actually respected Jalal for his display
of valor and willingness to resist them. Jalal fled to India via the
Khyber Pass with his pride intact. The khan headed south himself and
defeated Jalal al-Din along the banks of the Indus River. Following
their defeat of Jalal, the Mongols descended into India but quickly
found the hot and humid climate inhospitable; they decided to return to
Mongolia, arriving home by 1225. The Central Asia campaign had started
as a punitive expedition but in the process had wiped out any type of
resistance in the region.

In the interim, Genghis Khan had ordered Jebe and Sübedei to explore and
reconnoiter the West. Between 1221 and 1223, the two most gifted of the
khan's generals traveled towards Russia. In the course of their journey,
they defeated the Georgians, Armenians, princes of Rus, and Kipchak
Turkic tribes. Then they abruptly returned home. The purpose was not to
annex the territory but to gather intelligence, which proved to be
important to their campaign against the princes of Rus between 1236 and
1240. Meanwhile, Genghis Khan had died on expedition in southern China
in 1227. Upon his death, the Mongols participated in a year of mourning,
halting expansion.

### 11.8.3 Succession {.import-Header3}

The Mongols were the only steppe tribes whose empire actually expanded
upon the death of its founder. In fact, most of the Mongol conquests
actually transpired after the passing of Genghis Khan. Unlike previous
tribal confederations, it did not implode because Genghis Khan had
invented a safe and reliable means of transferring power. He also
stabilized Mongol society and made it less fractious, constructing a
framework for subsequent generations to follow. To maintain political
legitimacy and inherit the throne under this new system, one had to
trace their ancestry back to Genghis Khan through his wife Börte and her
four sons, Juchi, Chagatai, Ögedei, and Tolui. This concept dramatically
limited contenders for the khanate, mitigating future competition for
succession. Only they possessed the required **Genghis-Khanid**
**legitimacy**.

The khan's plan to transfer power upon his death also fused older steppe
traditions with his new vision. He bequeathed to his sons parts of the
world yet unconquered so that they had to win these new areas. This
stipulation produced an incentive for his sons to cooperate in order to
collect their patrimony. Genghis Khan had divided the four patrimonial
**ulus**, or states, amongst his sons. The four subsequent empires that
grew out of these ulus included the Golden Horde, who were the
descendants of **Juchi** and controlled Russia; the Chagatai Khanate,
which traced its lineage to **Chagatai** and governed Central Asia; the
Mongol-founded Yuan Dynasty in China, the progeny of **Tolui**; and the
Ilkhanate of Persia, inheritors of the House of Hülegü and also the
successors of **Tolui**.

::: __UNKNOWN__
Prior to his death in 1227, Genghis Khan expressed a desire that his son
**Ögedei** succeed him, a decision that affronted **Juchi**, his eldest,
whose lineage was questioned. Fortunately for the Mongols, Juchi's death
preceded that of his father's, narrowly averting a potential civil war.
A khuriltai in 1229 confirmed the khan's wishes, and it was under Ögedei
that the Mongols realized their destiny of world domination. Between
1230 and 1233, Ögedei's troops defeated the remnants of the Jin Dynasty
in central China. Then they focused their attention on Russia, as they
had actionable intelligence on the divisions among the Russian
principalities dating to a 1223 reconnaissance mission that utterly
crushed a coalition of Russian and Kipchak princes. In 1236, Ögedei
launched his campaign in the dead of winter and used rivers as frozen
ice highways. By the end of 1237, they had taken the Black Steppe,
Vladimir, and Riazan. It was only some fortuitous flooding that
prevented the complete destruction of Novgorod. The Prince of Novgorod
was, however, sufficiently impressed by the Mongol onslaught and
voluntarily agreed to pay their tribute. The Mongols commenced a
devastating attack on the city of Kiev in December of 1240, culminating
in a nine-day siege. Following Mongol military tradition, they
ultimately destroyed the city as retribution for its resistance. The
Mongols steamrolled the Hungarians soon thereafter and left the region
in ruins en route to Vienna. By December of 1241, their forces were
approaching the outskirts of the city, and no military power in Europe
was capable of withstanding a Mongol attack.

Fortunately for the Viennese, Ögedei died that very same month, and a
one-year period of mourning ensued. The Mongols were summoned home in
order to choose the next great khan. What was supposed to be a quick
election turned into a five-year ordeal because **Batu**, son of Juchi
and grandson of Genghis Khan, refused to return to Mongolia for the
khuriltai. This founder of the Golden Horde believed that he would not
be chosen and knew that his relatives could not officially convene a
khuriltai without him, thus preventing the body from proclaiming the
next great khan. It was Ögedei's death and Batu's independence of
thought that saved Europe from Mongol conquest.

</figure>

The khuriltai finally proclaimed **Güyük**, eldest son of Ögedei, the
next khan in 1246. This was not a legitimate election, though, because
of Batu's conspicuous absence. Güyük quickly dispatched an army to
punish Batu for meddling in the political process of succession, but
Batu had already arranged for his cousin's assassination in 1248.
Güyük's death led to another period of paralysis. A khuriltai eventually
nominated **Möngke**, Tolui's oldest son, as the next great khan in
1251. Now Möngke had to deal with the problem that Batu presented. He
was willing to allow for Batu's autonomy so long as he recognized Möngke
as the legitimate khan. It was at this point that Batu's horde become
the **Golden Horde**. He adopted the moniker of "golden" because he was
asserting his independence.

Batu died in 1256, and his younger brother **Berke** became the first
khan of the Golden Horde to accept Islam. This sudden conversion to
Islam caused systemic problems in the Mongol Empire because different
parts of the four lines of Genghis Khan would adopt different faiths,
resulting in political divisions that aligned with religious divisions.
As a Muslim, Berke spurned his Buddhist cousins and established firm
links with the Turkic Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, thus making an alliance
based on faith with a power outside of the Mongol Empire.

Genghis Khan's empire had exceeded normal steppe expectations, and with
potential fault lines emerging already, his vision of a politically
unified empire was never truly realized. A series of civil wars erupted
not long thereafter that fractured the Mongol Empire. First came the
Toluid Civil War (1260--1264), then the Berke-Hülegü War (1262), and
finally the Kaidu-Kublai War (1268--1301). These three wars had the
combined effect of undermining the great khan's authority, and the
empire ended up breaking apart along the lines of the patrimonial ulus,
with each moving in their own direction. In fact, the successors of
**Kublai Khan** (1260--1294), who presided over the Yuan Dynasty in
China, could not even convene a khuriltai to appoint a great khan
following his death. By 1294, there was neither fiction nor façade of a
unified Mongol Empire. It was the end of a unified political unit.

## 11.9 THE KHANATE OF CHAGATAI {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Chagatai (1226--1241), the second son of Genghis and his wife Börte, had
participated in his father's campaigns, and in 1227, he claimed his
patrimonial territory designated as between the Caspian Sea and the
Tarim Basin. The origins of the **Chagatai Khanate** shaped its
political and demographic character; Chagatai obtained the core of
Central Asia, a personal pastureland located along the Kazakh steppe. He
also received the settled lands to the south in modern-day Uzbekistan.
Chagatai never demonstrated ambition for the position of great khan;
rather, he played an important role helping his brother Ögedei exercise
authority and uphold Yassa. In doing so, Chagatai served as the glue
that helped hold the Mongol Empire together.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 530px">

</figure>

As was the case with his father, Genghis Khan, Chagatai had trouble
coping with the cultural differences that existed between nomadic steppe
and settled societies. His solution to the conflict between these two
civilizations was known as **Inju**, a dual-administrative system and a
form of indirect rule. Inju was a political concession designed to
separate the two incompatible cultures, allowing both to maintain their
own traditional laws yet remain subject to the authority of Chagatai and
his descendants. Chagatai was conscious not to force Yassa on sedentary
Muslim cities; however, it continued to be exercised on the plains. In
agricultural and urban areas, a bureaucratic tradition with a Muslim
administration persisted. So long as these Muslims did not openly resist
Mongol control, they could go about their daily business, free from
Mongol interference in their life. It was in this way that the steppe
continued to abide by customary Mongol law, while in the south, the
people of the cities lived according to the Sharia, or Quranic law.

Inju was also an economic arrangement granting the Mongols a share of
the resources produced in sedentary lands. The Mongols rewarded those
who cooperated in governance with a portion of the profits; those who
participated in Inju were entitled to their allotment of the common
imperial settled possessions. At first, all of the conquered towns
remained the property of the khan, but over time, access to the wealth
of the urban areas extended to the nomads who took part in Inju.

Although Inju was a practical solution to the difficulty of governing
the two separate societies, it ultimately did not resolve the problem of
uniting the sedentary Turkic population and the nomadic Mongols since it
failed to accommodate the needs of either society. Actually, it
encouraged friction between the two civilizations because it placed
hardships on both peoples. While the horsemen benefited handsomely from
Inju, they considered it incompatible with their traditional practices
because it forced them to climb down from their steeds and settle down
in the cities. Yes, the Mongols did receive tribute, slaves, and status
as compensation for the inconvenience of ruling over settled lands, but
the costs of sustaining this empire were heavy. It was just too
demanding for them to uphold. First, the maintenance of empire disrupted
the nomadic way of life because they often had to join in exhaustive
campaigns, lasting years at a time. Second, the nomads were unaccustomed
to a considerable amount of government interference in their daily
routine. Increasingly, they viewed the prospect of governing an empire
as a burden and preferred to revert to a pastoral lifestyle on the
prairie. They sought more independence and stability, so they
consciously began to defect from the system and return to their
pastures.

Those living in the settled lands to the south chaffed under Inju as
well. Though they recognized that government remained an essential part
of life, Inju encumbered urban-dwelling and farming peoples too. The
Mongols stressed this population by raising additional taxes in an
unpredictable and disruptive manner. This annoyed the city folk, who
were accustomed to more regular taxation. Ultimately, Inju did not mesh
well with either lifestyle. The practice rested on force, not utility.
The Mongol state sustained two different societies that often remained
in conflict, so it stayed in a state of permanent instability.

### 11.9.1 Turko-Mongol Fusion {.import-Header3}

The Mongols were the first to unify the Eurasian steppe, and their
occupation of the region corresponded to a wholesale takeover. As they
migrated southwest down the steppe, they failed to displace the Turkic
peoples already established in Central Asia. Early on, the dominant
Mongols offered these Turkic groups a deal to either merge with them or
suffer harsh reprisal. So as the Mongols progressed westward, their
armies gained strength, as more and more of the Turkic tribesmen joined
them, resulting in armies that were mostly comprised of Turkic peoples,
not Mongols. In this manner, the Turkic groups absorbed and assimilated
the invading Mongols, a process known as **Turkification**; the conflict
between the two cultures faded over time and eventually led to a fusion
of Turkic and Mongolian societies. Over time, these Mongol pastoralists
presiding over a sedentary Islamic culture slowly Turkified. They
quickly became a Mongol minority governing a Turkic majority.

There were numerous points of contention between the two groups but also
many commonalities. Both societies had originated on the steppe in
modern-day Mongolia, and while the Turkic groups had settled down over
the years and adopted more of a sedentary existence, many of the
principles of pastoral nomadism still lingered in their culture. Both
adhered to a patrimonial distribution of inheritance. Also, both the
Turkic groups and the Mongols organized along tribal lines, and each
followed a pattern of co-opting one tribe into another, thus
facilitating a fusion of the Mongols with their Turkic hosts. For this
system to work, though, the Mongols had to speak the idiom of the people
they ruled. So instead of the Mongols imposing their language on the
majority of the population, the Mongol elite learned Chagatai, a Turkic
tongue.

For many years, religion remained the only major distinction between the
two societies, but once the Chaghatayids converted to Islam in 1333,
this conspicuous difference disappeared. While the Mongols adopted the
creed and language of the Turkic Chagatai, these Turkic peoples
incorporated the Mongol political concept of Genghis-Khanid legitimacy.

## 11.10 THE KHANATE OF THE ILKHANS (1265--1335) {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

**Hülegü** **Khan** (1256--1265), grandson of Genghis Khan and son of
Tolui, served his brother Möngke (1251--1259), the great khan, and
campaigned through the Middle East, where he whipped out the Assassins,
a secret order of schismatic Shia entrenched in the mountains of Gilan
province in 1256. He also destroyed the Abbasid capital of Baghdad in
1258. By 1260, Hülegü controlled parts of Armenia, Iraq, and Anatolia;
all of Azerbaijan; and all of Iran. Kublai Khan (1250--1294) had awarded
his brother Hülegü the title of Ilkhan, a secondary khan who remained
subordinate only to the great khan in Mongolia. This portion of the
empire became known as the **Khanate of the Ilkhans**.

Ad-Din’s “History of the World.” Author: Rachid Ad-Din Source: Wikimedia

</figure>

The Ilkhans were a Mongol minority ruling over a Muslim majority;
religious problems plagued the Ilkhanate for much of its existence. To
begin with, Hülegü, a Nestorian Christian, who later converted to
Buddhism on his deathbed, had sacked Baghdad, one of the most
politically important cities in the Islamic world, an act that alienated
him from his Muslim cousin **Berke Khan**, ruler of the Golden Horde.
The conversion of the Golden Horde to Islam had presented a real
problem, for the Ilkhans had initially championed Buddhism in Iraq and
Iran. As animosity continued to mount between the two parts of the
Mongol Empire over religious differences, we see growing ties of
alliance between the Muslim Golden Horde and their coreligionists, the
Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, against the Ilkhans. Belief transcended
blood, as one part of Mongol Empire allied against another with an
outside source. Faith-based civil wars consumed much of the reign of
**Abaga Khan** (1265--1282). These wars were rooted in the Ilkhanate's
inappropriate treatment of their Muslim population. The Golden Horde's
alliance with the Mamluks threatened the Ilkhanate, and yet no longer
could Abaga rely on the full might of centralized Mongol power; he was
forced to appeal to Kublai Khan to assuage the hostilities between the
Ilkhans and the Golden Horde.

Much of the religious conflict during the early Ilkhanate related to
doctrinal differences between Islam and the traditional Mongol way of
life. The most stubborn problem for the two was the contradiction
between the traditional Mongolian method of animal slaughter, which
required that no blood be spilled, and the Islamic code of cleanliness,
which necessitated that all blood be drained. Each side was appalled by
the other's customs. Furthermore, as practitioners of rigid monotheism,
Muslims found the Mongol worship of religious images repulsive, a ritual
strictly forbidden in Islam.

While spiritual troubles remained a persistent problem for the Ilkhans,
the economic situation deteriorated too. **Gaykhatu** **Khan**
(1291--1295) practically emptied the royal treasury with profligate
spending. He experimented with paper money recently adopted from China
to compensate for his wasteful expenditures, but overprinting resulted
in massive inflation. The Ilkhans also tried to extract the maximum
amount of tribute from the countryside to offset declining revenues.
This led to an abuse in tax gathering, known as tax farming, in which
rulers sold contracts for the collection of revenues to the highest
bidder. This method of tax collection provided a strong incentive to
despoil peasants.

It was **Mahmud** **Ghazan** (1295--1304) who solved the Ilkhanate's
continued religious and economic problems. Despite the early looting and
plundering indicative of a Mongol conquest, the Ilkhans eventually
reactivated the Silk Road and promoted transcontinental trade. The
newfound safety of the route throughout Eurasia stimulated trade and
encouraged many different kinds of cultures to come together. Ghazan
attempted to reform the tax policies that had led to the maximization of
taxation. Cities did revive, but the long-term negative consequence of
conquest continued to be felt by the peasants who suffered from
prolonged violence.

Mahmud Ghazan was the first Ilkhan to convert to Islam, thus
rehabilitating their image in the eyes of their Muslim subjects and
making their rule much more acceptable. Their new public stance towards
Islam moderated persistent conflict and paved the way for cultural
flourishing. Ghazan patronized Ilkhanid art, scholarship, and science.
Ilkhanid art reflected Chinese influence and helped contribute to
Persian artistic development. In terms of scholarship, the first true
history of the world was completed under the sponsorship of Mahmud
Ghazan. Written by **Rashid al-Din** **Hamadani** (1247--1318), the book
was richly illustrated with watercolors and portraiture in the Chinese
style. Through his travels in the service of the Mongols, Rashid al-Din
had become perceptively aware of Ilkhanid Persia's cosmopolitan culture.
It was Rashid al-Din, a Jewish convert to Islam, who had convinced
Mahmud Ghazan to adopt the faith in order to be more attuned to the
beliefs of his peoples. Regarding science, the Ilkhands attempted to
amass large amounts of astronomical data from China to Europe. With
unprecedented accuracy, they became very good at predicting lunar
eclipses. Their data was used throughout Eurasia.

Much like the Mongols in Chaghatai Central Asia, we see a Persian-Mongol
fusion, as they began to identify with Persian culture and speak the
Persian language. As they bonded with Persia, they adopted Islam and
began to promote Persian as the written language of their land.

## 11.11 TIMUR {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

It was under **Timur** (1370--1405) that Central Asia moved to the fore
of world events. He is also known as Tamerlane, or Timur-the-lame as a
result of battlefield injuries to his right hand and leg. Timur
attempted to soothe the persistent differences that existed between the
nomadic steppe and sedentary societies and actually developed a
political arrangement that could harness the best attributes of each
society, without the dangerous side effect of communal violence
associated with combining the two civilizations. He also constructed a
new political and military machine that was deeply ingrained in the
political background of the Chagatai Khanate, even while he acknowledged
that Inju satisfied neither the nomad nor the settled society and
eliminated the practice. Astutely recognizing that serious conflict
existed between these two incongruent cultures under his control, Timur
provided a framework for both societies to live in harmony.

Born in 1336 near Kesh in modern-day Uzbekistan, Timur came out of
Central Asia and was a product of the Turko-Mongol fusion. He descended
from an aristocratic Mongol clan, but he was raised as a Muslim and
spoke a Turkic language. Although Timur himself was a native to
Transoxiana, he could not assert Genghis-Khanid legitimacy. Unable to
trace his ancestry to Genghis Khan, he could not take the title of khan
in his own right. Timur understood that because he did not have the
correct pedigree, he would have to earn it. His solution was to take the
title of emir, meaning commander, and rule through a Chaghatayid puppet
khan acting as a figurehead. The emir also married into the family of
Genghis Khan. While the law of descent was not intended to work this
way, Timur changed it to accommodate his children, who would be able to
claim Genghis-Khanid legitimacy.

</figure>

To strengthen the security of his position as emir, he constructed a
system of support that ordered his political connections in a series of
concentric rings. In his primary circle resided his family and close
allies. The second ring consisted of loyal tribes and Timur's own Barlas
Clan, from which he traced his lineage. The third circle was made up of
those peoples Timur had defeated on the battlefield; the second and
third rings balanced one another. The outermost bands included Timur's
hereditary professional administrators and bureaucrats, soldiers from
the plains serving in his cavalry units, and finally the Persian urban
and agricultural populations, from which he recruited his infantry and
siege units.

Like many transitional figures in history, such as Suleiman the
Magnificent, Timur bridged the medieval and modern worlds. He attempted
to imitate Genghis Khan's success in the field and designed a novel
military machine that was well adapted to the environment in which he
lived. His military was the product of a Turko-Mongol fusion, employing
Turkic siege techniques and the Mongol cavalry. Unlike Genghis Khan,
however, Timur increasingly combined his cavalry, siege, and infantry
units, placing his heavy cavalry at the center of formations. His army
also utilized an early form of artillery. He ventured to monopolize the
market on gunpowder technology so that other powers could not benefit
from it.

Timur was determined to keep his volatile army occupied, so they would
not be a burden to the sedentary population in his realm. It was in this
context that he developed a formula for success that promoted peace at
home and war abroad, a policy that best served the interests of the
merchants and townspeople. He externalized the violence of the steppe
and destroyed all of the other trade routes that bypassed his territory.
Timur attempted to reactivate and dominate the Silk Road and diverted
trade to his lands in order to help rebuild the cities that had been
damaged from years of Mongol and nomad rule. He did not aim at permanent
occupation or the creation of new states; he just wanted to devastate,
even going so far as to campaign against the Golden Horde, Delhi
Sultanate, and the Ottoman Empire, all in an effort to redirect trade in
his direction.

Timur began his military campaigns attempting to secure the back door of
the steppe. During this period, which lasted from 1370 to 1385, he
conquered and subdued Mogholistan to the northeast, with the aim of
securing the core central land route of the Silk Road. (The Chagatai
Khanate had already been divided into two parts by the 1340s,
Transoxania in the west and Mogholistan in the east.) Then he engaged
the Golden Horde between 1385 and 1395. The Golden Horde had been the
master of the northern trade route that bypassed Timur's territory. In
order to eliminate this option, he went to war against them in order to
divert trade toward his lands. Timur showed his strategic genius in
these expeditions. He put the pieces of his army together in such a way
so that he could take his enemies on in their arena and on their terms.
In this manner, Timur crushed **Tokhtamysh**, leader of the Golden
Horde, in 1395. During the course of this campaign, Timur destroyed
their principle trade cities of Astrakhan and Sarai. An interesting
byproduct of Timur's campaign against the Golden Horde was that it
precipitated the rise of the **Grand Duchy of Moscow**. He had weakened
the Golden Horde to such an extent that it made it possible for Moscow
to throw off the Mongol yoke (although that would take a few more
decades, until 1480).

Timur raided into India from 1398 to 1399 and dealt a blow to the
southern sea route that connected the West to Asia. This expedition was
primarily for looting, since he never intended to conquer and annex the
territory of **Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq**, the last member of
the Tughluq Dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. During this campaign,
Timur's tactical brilliance was on full display; he had an uncanny
ability to adapt to any martial environment that he confronted. For
instance, when threatened with a cavalry of war elephants, Timur
responded by unleashing a pack of camels laden with incendiary material
to charge the enemy lines. Shrieking dromedaries with their backs ablaze
incited utter pandemonium among Nasir-ud-Din's cavalry of elephants, who
rampaged through the sultan's own lines. Timur easily routed the
sultan's forces. When faced with the townspeople of Delhi rising up
against their aggressors, Timur brutally sacked the capital of the
sultanate and justified the violence in religious terms. His was a
Muslim victory over the Hindu unbelievers of India.

In Timur's final period of conquest, which lasted from 1400 to 1404, he
campaigned against the Islamic far west, directing his army against the
Ottomans. Actually, Timur had initially attempted to avoid conflict with
the Ottomans, whose forces had earned an impressive reputation on the
battlefield. In fact, Timur had even tried to negotiate with Bayezid I,
the Ottoman Sultan, offering him part of Golden Horde's territory west
of Dnieper River. But these two expansionist realms inevitably came into
conflict in eastern Anatolia. The conflict between the two empires began
as the Ottomans expanded to the east and took control of some Turkmen
tribes in eastern Anatolia already under the protection of Timur. The
emir responded by taking some other Turkmen tribes under Ottoman
suzerainty. Offensive missives replete with insulting incriminations
ensued. Timur bided his time, waiting for the perfect moment to attack
the Ottomans. In 1402, he launched a devastating attack into the heart
of Anatolia, as the Ottomans were preoccupied with campaigning against
the Hungarians. During the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Timur managed to
convince many of the Ottoman forces to defect to his side. He captured
the Ottoman sultan, who died in captivity three months later. Timur had
not attempted to conquer the Ottomans; he just wanted to punish them for
their unwillingness to cooperate. His Levantine expedition also seems to
have been designed to weaken the western terminus of the Silk Road in
Aleppo, Syria.

Timur died in 1405 while on a campaign against the Ming Dynasty. He had
built an empire that spanned the breadth of Central Asia. Unlike Genghis
Khan, whose empire continued to expand after his death, the sons of
Timur and their followers squabbled over succession, leading to a series
of internecine battles. Members of the Timurid Dynasty competed among
themselves, with commanders switching loyalties. The empire consequently
fragmented. The successors of Timur could not manage the difficulties of
governing an empire, and it withered away quickly. The political
situation resembled that which Chagatayids had to contend with, the
steppe military that had been redirected, but with Timur's death, they
returned. A number of Timurid rulers followed; a weak state emerged from
all this strife.

### 11.11.1 Terror and Destruction {.import-Header3}

Timur certainly committed what we would describe today as war crimes;
there definitely was an element of terrorism to his campaigns. In fact,
as an admirer of architecture, he is known to have constructed pyramids
of human skulls. Extant accounts describe him slaughtering 100,000
Indian prisoners following the Delhi uprising. But not all destruction
was the same; and there was a definite difference between that of
Genghis Khan and Timur. The emir's annihilation of the region was not
meant to serve a utilitarian purpose so much as to inflict suffering.
Genghis Khan used terror as a method to protect his troops, whereas
Timur engaged in terror and destruction for pleasure.

### 11.11.2 Legacy {.import-Header3}

A product of the Turko-Mongolian fusion, Timur had been the first to
reunite the eastern and western parts of the Chagatai ulus. His empire
represents the construction of the political boundaries passed down to
posterity; the maintenance of this space would define boundaries of
modern-day Central Asia up to the twentieth century. Under Timur, we see
growing political and cultural distinctions between Iran, Central Asia
proper, and India begin to cement. In this context, we see a split
taking place on the steppe that will lead to a differentiation of the
Uzbeks and Kazaks. By the late fourteenth century, the tribes on the
steppe to the north will become known to Muslim writers as Kazaks,
whereas the tribes to the south will be increasingly referred to as
Uzbeks, a differentiation that has continued to persist and helped to
delimit modern borders.

## 11.12 CONCLUSION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Three forces combined to shape the course of Central Asian history: the
Turkic migrations, expansion of Islam, and the Mongol conquest.
Beginning in the second century BCE, waves of Turkic migrations entered
the region. It is debatable whether or not they Turkified the original
Iranian inhabitants or permanently changed the ethnic makeup of the
area. Turkic tribes occupied the great steppe, Turkifying the region and
endowing it with a more nomadic character. They also populated the
agricultural basin of Transoxiana, displacing the original Iranian
inhabitants of the area. Many of these Turks slowly settled down over
time. These Turkic peoples displayed a unique ability to absorb the
Islamic faith and internalize the Mongol conquest.

Islam transformed the religious adherence of Central Asia and left a
lasting mark on the region as well. Transoxiana gradually Islamicized,
but Turkic and Persian cultures persisted. Islamization incorporated
native peoples in the process of conversion. As Islam spread through the
area, the faith demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to incorporate
local traditions, permitting some customs to linger so long as doing so
accelerated conversion. Sufi missionaries made some compromises with the
Turkic nomadic culture in order to establish the religion in the area.
Sufism's inherent flexibility helped to promote conversion, and the
blend of orthodox Islam and Turkic pastoral nomadism created a uniquely
Central Asian brand of the faith.

The Mongol conquest of Central Asia had the most immediate impact on the
history of the region. Although the Mongols eventually Turkified over
time, the legacy of Genghis-Khanid legitimacy remained. Genghis Khan had
developed a secure and dependable means of transferring power which
reduced the number of contenders vying for the throne; the Mongols did
not collapse as a "nation" following the death of their founder. Genghis
Khan bequeathed a legacy of political legitimacy to the region that
would last until the twentieth century.

## 12.2 INTRODUCTION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

15 July 1099: The Al-Aqsa Mosque looked down on the city of Jerusalem,
the light of the sun reflecting off of its golden dome. Down below the
hill on which the mosque stood, a scene of slaughter was unfolding. Up
against the northern wall of the city stood a wooden tower laboriously
rolled into place hours earlier, over the top of which had poured a
desperate band of European knights, the first over the walls of the Holy
City.

Within the walls, the narrow, winding streets between the ancient stone
buildings of the city rang with the clash of steel on steel and the
cries of the dead and dying. Smoke from fires breaking out within the
city mingled with the smell of death. In parts of the city, its
defenders, Muslim Egyptians, were still fighting, going down under the
sword strokes of the Christian soldiers fighting their way through the
streets. In the southwest, a small group of defenders had retreated into
the more heavily fortified citadel where they were negotiating a
surrender with Count Raymond of Toulouse, a shrewd but irascible noble
from the south of France.

Elsewhere in the city, the killing of the soldiers was giving way to a
more horrific slaughter, as the mail-clad knights cut down men, women,
and children where they stood, torturing some with fire and threatening
others with worse if they did not turn over their valuables. By the end
of the day, the Christian soldiers hacking their way through the city
streets waded through blood up to their ankles.

As the day went on, soldiers pushed through the piles of dismembered
corpses to the golden-domed Al-Aqsa Mosque. The mosque stood where
Solomon's temple had been millennia before, and the knights, smeared
with the blood of slaughter, fell to their knees in prayer, grateful
that God had delivered their enemies into their hands.

These men had traveled more than two thousand miles by land and sea.
Tens of thousands of their comrades lay dead along the way from
starvation, thirst, disease, or battle. But these warriors had made it
from their European homelands to seize control of the city of Jerusalem,
a city sacred to Jew, Christian, and Muslim, and bring it under
Christian rule for the first time in more than four centuries.

An army made up of many of the soldiers of Western Europe had managed to
successfully make war on its Muslim enemies and seize territories in the
Middle East, near the heart of Muslim culture and political power. How
had they done so? And why? To understand, we must look at how the
European Christian world had developed over the eleventh century.

In the years between about 1000 and 1500, the culture and institutions
of Western Europe took on a form that was distinct from the post-Roman
Germanic kingdoms of the early Middle Ages and which would, in many
ways, lay the foundations of Europe (and the Americas) into modern
times. At the end of this period, thinkers seeking to bring about a new
birth of ancient learning would look back on the thousand years that had
come before as the Middle Ages, a period between the world of the
Ancient Greeks and Romans and their own. But although these thinkers
ostentatiously rejected the Middle Ages, they were in many ways its
heirs. To see how this culture developed, we shall begin in Western
Europe in the chaotic years of the early eleventh century.

## 12.3 QUESTIONS TO GUIDE YOUR READING {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

- Who held most political and military power in a feudal system?

## 12.5 THE EMERGENCE OF A FEUDAL ORDER IN WESTERN EUROPE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Out of the chaos and mayhem of the tenth and eleventh centuries,
**East** **Francia**---the eastern third of Charlemagne's empire that is
in roughly the same place as modern Germany---and England had emerged as
united and powerful states. In the aftermath of the Abbasid Caliphate's
political collapse and the gradual weakening of Fatimid Egypt (see
Chapter Eight), the eleventh-century Byzantine Empire was the strongest,
most centralized state in the Eastern Mediterranean and, indeed,
probably the strongest state west of Song China.

Most of the rest of Christian Western Europe's kingdoms, however, were
fragmented. This decentralization was most acute in **West**
**Francia**, the western third of what had been Charlemagne's empire.
This kingdom would eventually come to be known as France. Out of a weak
and fragmented kingdom emerged the decentralized form of government that
historians often call **feudalism**. We call it feudalism because power
rested with armed men in control of plots of agricultural land known as
**fiefs**, and Latin for fief is *feudum*. Landholders would use the
surplus from these fiefs to equip themselves with weapons and equipment,
and they often controlled their fiefs with little oversight from the
higher-ranked nobles or the king.

How had such a system emerged? Even in Carolingian times, armies in much
of Western Europe had come from war bands made up of a king's loyal
retainers, who themselves would possess bands of followers. Ultimate
control of a kingdom's army had rested with the king, and the great
nobles had also exercised strong authority over their own fighting men.
The near constant warfare (both external attacks and civil wars) of the
tenth and eleventh centuries, however, meant that the kings of West
Francia gradually lost control over the more powerful nobles. Further,
the powerful nobles often lost control of the warlords of more local
regions. West Francia had little governmental authority and much war.

As a result of constant warfare (albeit warfare that was usually local
in scope), power came to rest in control of fiefs and the ability to
extract surplus from their occupants and to use this surplus to outfit
armed men. The warlords who controlled fiefs often did so by means of
armed fortresses called castles. At first, especially in northern parts
of West Francia, these fortresses were of wood and might sometimes be as
small as a wooden palisade surrounding a fortified wooden tower. Over
the eleventh and twelfth centuries, these wooden castles came to be
replaced with fortifications of stone. A castle had two roles: it would
protect a land from attackers (such as Viking raiders), but it would
also serve as a base for the control and extortion of a land's people.

The castle represented Europe's feudal order in wood and stone.
Corresponding to the physical structure of the castle was the figure of
the knight. Knights in the eleventh century wore an armor called **chain
mail**---that is, interlocking rings of metal that would form a coat of
armor. The knight usually fought on horseback, wielding a long spear
known as a lance in addition to the sword at his side. With his feet
resting in stirrups, a knight could hold himself firmly in the saddle,
directing the weight and power of a charging horse into the tip of his
lance.

Knights and castles came to dominate West Francia and then other parts
of Europe for several reasons. The technology of ironworking was
improving so that iron was cheaper (although still very expensive) and
more readily available, allowing for knights to wear more armor than
their predecessors. Moreover, warfare of the tenth and eleventh
centuries was made up of raids (both those of Vikings and of other
Europeans). A raid depends on mobility, with the raiders able to kill
people and seize plunder before defending soldiers can arrive. Mounted
on horseback, knights were mobile enough that they could respond rapidly
to raids. The castle allowed a small number of soldiers to defend
territory. It was also a deterrent to raiders since it meant that quick
plunder might not be possible.

A knight's equipment---mail, lance, and horse---was incredibly
expensive, as was the material and labor to construct even a wooden
castle. Although knights had originally been whichever soldiers had been
able to get the equipment to fight, the expense of this equipment and
thus the need to control a fief to pay for it meant that knights
gradually became a warrior aristocracy, with greater rights than the
peasants whose labor they controlled. Indeed, often, the rise of knights
and castles meant that many peasants lost their freedom, becoming serfs.
**Serfs** were unfree peasants who, although not property that could be
bought and sold like slaves, were nevertheless bound to their land and
subordinate to those who controlled it.

The regions of West Francia controlled by powerful nobles were nearly
independent of the crown. But even at the Frankish monarchy's weakest,
these nearly independent nobles were understood to hold their
territories from the king and to owe allegiance to him if he called on
them for military service. In this way, feudalism of the European Middle
Ages resembled Western Zhou feudalism. The smaller fiefs that made up
the territories of these great nobles likewise were understood to be
held from these nobles; the knight who held a fief was, at least in
theory, required to render military service to the lord from whom he
held it. In practice, though, the kingdom of West Francia (and other
regions of Western Europe where such a system held sway) had little
cohesion as a state, with most functions of a state like minting money,
building roads and bridges, and trying and executing criminals in the
hands of the powerful nobles.

### *12.5.1 Global Context* {.import-Header3}

Thus far, we have discussed feudalism in eleventh-century Western
Europe, but a decentralized state dominated by a warrior aristocracy
could emerge anywhere that central authority broke down. A similar
system emerged in Heian Japan of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
when mounted soldiers (in this case, samurai rather than knights) came
to occupy the social role of a warrior aristocracy (see Chapter Four).
Such an arrangement would emerge at the same time in the Middle East:
the Great Saljuq Empire was dominated by mounted warriors in control of
*iqtas*, units of land whose revenues (often from taxation) would fund
these warriors, who in turn held their iqtas from the sultan.

## 12.6 GROWTH OF TOWNS AND TRADE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Although the eleventh century was in many ways Western Europe's nadir,
it would also see the beginnings of Western Europe's re-urbanization.
One reason for this was that in those lands that had been part of the
Western Roman Empire, city walls often remained, even if the cities had
largely emptied of people. During the chaos and mayhem of the tenth and
eleventh centuries, people often gathered in walled settlements for
protection. Many of these old walled cities thus came to be re-occupied.

Another reason for the growth of towns came with a revival of trade in
the eleventh century. This revival of trade can be traced to several
causes. In the first place, Europe's knights, as a warrior aristocracy,
had a strong demand for luxury goods, both locally manufactured products
and imported goods such as silks and spices from Asia. Bishops, the
great lords of the Church, had a similar demand. As such, markets grew
up in the vicinity of castles and thus caused the formation of towns
that served as market centers, while cathedral cities also saw a growth
of population. Moreover, Viking raids had also led to a greater
sea-borne trade in the North Sea and Atlantic. Often, Viking-founded
markets served as the nucleus of new towns, especially in those lands
where the Romans had never established a state and which were not
urbanized at all. The Irish city of Dublin, for example, began as a
Viking trading post.

Further south, in the Mediterranean, frequent raids by pirates (most of
whom were Arab Muslims from North Africa) had forced the coastal cities
of Italy to build effective navies. One of these cities was Venice, a
city in the swamps and lagoons of northeastern Italy. Over the eleventh
century, the city (formerly under Byzantine rule but now independent)
built a navy that cleared the Adriatic Sea of pirates and established
itself as a nexus of trade between Constantinople and Western Europe.
Likewise, on the western side of Italy, the cities of Genoa and Pisa
built navies from what had been modest fishing fleets and seized the
strongholds of Muslim pirates in Corsica and Sardinia. This clearing of
pirates led to an increase in maritime trade and allowed the renewed
growth of the old Roman towns that had in many cases remained since the
fall of the Western Empire. The cities of Genoa and Venice were able to
prosper because they stood at the northernmost points of the
Mediterranean, the farthest that goods could be moved by water (always
cheaper than overland transport in premodern times) before going over
land to points further north.

alt="Medieval Market, Fifteenth Century" /></span>

</figure>

As goods moved north and south between the trade zones of the North Sea
and the Mediterranean, nobles along that north-south route realized that
they could enrich themselves by taxing markets. They thus sponsored and
protected markets in regions of West Francia like Champagne, which
themselves would serve as centers of urbanization and economic activity.

The people living and working in towns came to be known as the
**bourgeois**, or middle class. These were called a *middle* class
because they were neither peasant farmers nor nobles but rather a social
rank between the two. Kings and other nobles would frequently give towns
the right to self-government, often in exchange for a hefty payment. A
self-governing town was often known as a **commune.**

## 12.7 GROWTH IN AGRICULTURE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Eleventh-century Europe's economy was primarily agricultural. The
eleventh and twelfth centuries saw a massive expansion of agricultural
output in the northern regions of Europe, which led to a corresponding
growth in the economy and population. The same improvement in iron
technology that allowed the equipping of armored knights led to more
iron tools: axes allowed farmers to clear forests and cultivate more
land, and the iron share of a heavy plow allowed farmers to plow deeper
into the thick soil of Western Europe. In addition, farmers gradually
moved to a so-called **three--field** **system** of agriculture: fields
would have one-third given over to cereal crops; one-third to crops such
as legumes (which increase fertility in soil); and a third left
fallow---i.e.,
uncultivated [to]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}either
serve as grazing land for livestock or simply rebuild nutrients by lying
unused. More iron tools and new agricultural techniques caused yields to
rise from 3:1 to nearly 8:1 and in some fertile regions even higher.
Another factor in the rise of agricultural yields was Europe's climate,
which was becoming warmer in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth
centuries. This is known as the **Medieval Warm Period** or **Medieval
Climatic Optimum**. As a result of both climate and new agricultural
tools and techniques, food supplies increased so that Western Europe
would go through the majority of the twelfth century without
experiencing a major famine.

We should note that while agricultural yields were rising in Europe,
they were also rising in Song China (see Chapter Four). Indeed, compared
to China, Europe's agricultural production was still relatively meager.
It was nevertheless enough to bring about a dramatic growth in Europe's
population.

## 12.8 A ROMAN EMPIRE? {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Although the Carolingian Empire had collapsed in the ninth century and
West Francia remained fragmented, in Central Europe, the rulers of East
Francia formed a new empire on the wreck of Charlemagne's. King Otto I
of East Francia defeated the Magyars in 955 (see Chapter Seven). Otto
and his powerful nobles further subordinated the Slavic peoples to the
east to his rule, forcing
them [to]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}either
submit to his direct rule or acknowledge him as their overlord. He
followed up on the prestige gained from his victory over the Magyars by
exercising influence in Northern Italy, intervening in a dispute between
Pope John XII (r. 955--964) and Berengar, a petty king. On 2 February
962, Pope John XII crowned Otto as Roman Emperor in a ceremony meant to
echo Pope Leo III's crowning of Charlemagne over a century and a half
before. Further, Otto deposed Berengar and added Italy to his domains.

Otto was the most powerful ruler in Europe besides the Byzantine
emperor. His empire covered most of the German-speaking lands of Central
Europe: indeed, Otto and its subsequent emperors would be Germans, and
the power base of this empire would be firmly Central European. This
empire also encompassed Northern Italy and much of the territory west of
the Rhine. The rulers of this empire would call themselves Roman
Emperors and consider themselves the successors to Charlemagne and thus
to the Roman Empire. This empire, however, was more modest than
Charlemagne's. Although its emperors would claim that all Christian
kings owed them obedience, most other realms of Western Europe were
independent, especially West Francia (which we shall hereafter refer to
as France). Likewise, this empire's control of Northern Italy was always
somewhat tenuous, since its rulers' power was based in Germany, far to
the north of the Alps.

These emperors considered themselves to be Roman Emperors and protectors
of the Church---indeed, Otto I eventually deposed Pope John XII for
improperly fulfilling his papal duties. Because of this, historians call
their empire the Holy Roman Empire and its emperors Holy Roman Emperors.
The reader should carefully note that these emperors did not use either
of those titles. They simply referred to themselves as Roman Emperors
and their empire as the Roman Empire. We call the Empire the Holy Roman
Empire and the emperors Holy Roman Emperors for the convenience of
modern readers, so they will know they are not reading about the Roman
Empire, which dominated the entirety of the Mediterranean world in
ancient times, or the Byzantine Empire, a regional power in the Eastern
Mediterranean for most of the Middle Ages.

## 12.9 THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE'S PERIPHERIES: SECONDARY STATE FORMATION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Anthropologists speak of "secondary state formation," a process by which
people who live in a tribe or chiefdom on the periphery of a state will
gradually adopt statehood and the ideological trappings associated with
statehood. This often happens because a people will need to match the
resources of a state for raising armed forces or because a chief will
seek the prestige and power that comes from being recognized as a king.

In Scandinavia and in Eastern Europe, state formation occurred on the
margins of the Holy Roman Empire. In the late tenth century, the Danes,
the Poles (a Slavic people), and the Magyars formed the kingdoms of
Denmark, Poland, and Hungary, respectively. These kingdoms were often
**vassal states** (i.e., subordinate states) of the Ottonian emperors,
but they often fought to maintain their independence when they had the
capability to do so. Another key factor in the move from chiefdoms to
states was the adoption of Christianity: the Christian religion, as we
have seen earlier (see Chapter Seven), often legitimated a king. The
Christian Bible says that a prince is God's instrument of executing
justice.[^\[1\]^](#chapter-012-unknown-9.xhtml_footnote-548-1 "Romans 13:4"){#chapter-012-unknown-9.xhtml_return-footnote-548-1
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 1"} In exchange for their legitimation,
monarchs would protect the institutional Church. We can see this
relationship between Christianity and secondary state formation when
King Stephen I of Hungary received his crown from the papacy in the year
1000.

Far to the north, in Norway, a land of narrow fjords and valleys
surrounded by pine-covered mountains, King Olaf II was following a
similar set of policies. Olaf II was a Christian who had converted in
1013 while fighting in France. He spent his reign as king of Norway
(1015--1030) consolidating Norway into a kingdom that recognized royal
authority and converting that kingdom to Christianity.

### 12.9.1 Global Context

In Northern and Eastern Europe, secondary state formation had gone hand
in hand with the adoption of Christianity, which legitimated kings.
Clergy, familiar with the written word, provided the skills of literacy
to monarchs. A similar pattern occurred elsewhere in the world,
particularly in the African Sahel (see Chapter Nine). Between the tenth
and thirteenth centuries, as Ghana and Mali consolidated into states,
their rulers converted their people to Islam, which provided aid to
state-building similar to Christianity in Europe.

## 12.10 EXPANSION OF CHRISTENDOM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In the Middle Ages, the people of Western Europe did not think of Europe
as a geographic and cultural area. Rather, they thought of
**Christendom**, peoples and states that embraced the Christian religion
and shared common ideals and assumptions. We might compare it to the
Muslim notion of Dar al-Islam (see Chapter Eight). In the eleventh
century, Christendom expanded. Not only had the peoples to the north and
east embraced Christianity, but also Christian peoples and kingdoms in
the Western Mediterranean expanded militarily at the expense of Islam.
In Spain, the movement of the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain to
expand their territory at the expense of Muslim al-Andalus would come to
be known as the ***Reconquista***, or reconquest. It was known as the
*re*-conquest because there was a Christian kingdom in Spain in the
sixth and seventh centuries that fell to Muslim invaders in 711.
Christians would thus have assumed that Spain, even though much of it
might be Muslim ruled, was rightfully Christian. The effort by the
Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula to dominate, conquer, and
re-Christianize al-Andalus would become a key element in how Spanish
Christians understood their
identity [as]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}both
Christians and Spaniards.

How did the *Reconquista* begin? From the Muslim conquest of Spain in
711 through the early eleventh century, al-Andalus was the dominant
military power of the Iberian Peninsula, with Christian kingdoms
confined to the marginal, mountainous regions of the peninsula's north
(see Chapter Eight). But in 1008, Abd al-Rahman (also known as Sanjul),
the caliph's chief adviser, sought to make himself caliph and replace
the Umayyad dynasty with his own. The result was nearly three decades of
civil war. The Cordoba Caliphate collapsed in 1031, fracturing into what
we refer to as the ***taifa*** states, a set of small, politically-weak
states. These states were much weaker than the centralized Cordoba
Caliphate and so were easy prey for potential conquerors from both the
Christian north of the Iberian Peninsula and the Islamic Maghreb.

The Christian kingdoms of Spain had several strengths that enabled them
to expand at the expense of the *taifa* states. In the first place, the
*taifa* states were not only politically weak, but they were also at
odds with each other. In addition, the construction of stone castles in
newly-conquered territories allowed the Christian kings to secure their
conquests. Moreover, the Christian kingdoms of Spain could draw on much
of the rest of Western Europe for manpower. By the eleventh century, the
knight who inherited a fief would usually be the oldest son of the
fief's lord. This arrangement meant that Western Europe had many knights
who, as younger sons, did *not* inherit land from their fathers. These
landless knights were
looking [for]{style="font-size: 1em;"}[ ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}either
employment or fiefs of their own. New conquests along the frontier of
Muslim Spain thus gave them the perfect opportunity to seize their own
lands. As a result, French knights flowed south in a steady stream
across the Pyrenees.

</figure>

In Southern Italy, a group of knights from the region of France known as
Normandy (and who were thus called Normans) fought in the employ of the
Byzantine emperors against the Muslim rulers of North Africa and Sicily.
They eventually broke with the Byzantine emperors and created the
Kingdom of Sicily, a kingdom comprised of Sicily and Southern Italy, the
lands that they had seized from both the Byzantines and Sicilian
Muslims, with the last Muslim territory in Sicily conquered in 1091.
These knights too had come south to the Mediterranean in search of new
lands.

The Christian kingdoms of both Spain and Sicily were relatively tolerant
of their Muslim subjects. Although Muslims under Christian rule faced
civil disabilities similar to the *dhimmi* status of Jews and Christians
in Muslim-ruled lands, they had a broad array of rights and protections.
Indeed, the Christian kings of Sicily often employed Muslim mercenaries
in their military service. These victories by Christian forces over
Muslims would be of great interest to the popes, who were seeking to
reform the Church and to find ways that knights could be made to serve
Christian society.

## 12.11 CHURCH REFORM IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

By the eleventh century, Europe suffered from frequent violence, and the
Church itself was in a sorry state. Pope John XII, for example, the man
who had crowned Otto I, was so infamous for his immorality that it was
said that under his rule, the papal palace (called the Lateran) was
little better than a brothel. From the mid-eleventh century, both popes
and other clergymen would seek to reform both the institutional
structures of the Church and Christian society as a whole.

The Holy Roman Emperor Henry III (r. 1039--1056) set the reforming
papacy into motion. In 1049, he traveled to Rome to be crowned emperor.
When he arrived in the city, he found three men claiming to be pope,
each supported by a family of Roman nobles. The outraged emperor deposed
all three and replaced them with his own candidate, Pope Leo IX (r.
1049--1054). Leo IX would usher in a period in which reformers dominated
the papacy.

These popes believed that to reform the Church, they would need to do so
as its unquestioned leaders and that the institutional Church should be
independent from control of laypeople. The position of pope had long
been a prestigious one. According to Christian tradition, Peter, the
chief of Jesus Christ's disciples, had been the first bishop of Rome. He
was also killed in Rome. Eleventh-century popes increasingly argued that
the whole Church owed the popes the obedience that the disciples had
owed Peter, who himself had been given his authority by Christ.

Such a position was in many ways revolutionary. In the Byzantine Empire,
the emperors often directed the affairs of the Church (although such
attempts frequently went badly wrong as with the Iconoclast
Controversy). Western European kings appointed bishops, and the Holy
Roman Emperors believed that they had the right to both appoint and
depose popes. To claim the Church was independent of lay control went
against centuries of practice.

Moreover, not all churchmen recognized the absolute authority of the
pope. The pope was one of five churchmen traditionally known as
**patriarchs**, the highest-ranking bishops of the Church. The pope was
the patriarch of Rome; the other four were the patriarchs of
Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria. With Jerusalem and
Alexandria (and often Antioch) under Muslim rule, the patriarch of
Constantinople was the most prestigious of the Eastern Orthodox
patriarchs, dwelling in a city that was Rome's successor. The patriarchs
of Constantinople believed that the Roman pope had a place of honor
because Peter had resided in Rome, but they did not believe he had any
authority over other patriarchs.

### 12.11.1 The Filioque Controversy and the Split between Rome and Constantinople

This difference of opinion as to the authority of the pope would
eventually lead to conflict. The church following the pope (which we
will refer to as the Catholic Church), had a creed in its liturgy that
said that God the Holy Spirit proceeds both from God the Father and from
God the Son. The Eastern Orthodox version of this creed spoke of God the
Holy Spirit as proceeding only from God the Father. Representatives of
both churches quarreled over this wording, with the popes ordering the
Orthodox Churches to alter their creed. We thus call this controversy
the **Filioque Controversy**, since Latin for "and from the Son" is
*filioque*.

On 16 July 1054, Humbert of Silva Candida, the pope's **legate** (i.e.,
ambassador), together with his entourage stormed into the Hagia Sophia
as the patriarch was celebrating Communion and hurled a parchment scroll
onto the altar. The scroll decreed the patriarch to be excommunicated.
In response, the patriarch excommunicated the pope. Catholic and
Orthodox Churches were now split.

### 12.11.2 Simony and the Investiture Controversy

After the schism between Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the popes
focused on reforming the Church in the Catholic west. Two pressing
concerns of the popes were the elimination of **simony**, the buying and
selling of Church offices, and the protection of the Church's
independence from laypeople. This assertion of independence led to the
**Investiture Controversy**, a conflict between the popes and Holy Roman
Emperors (and other kings of Western Europe) over who had the right to
appoint bishops and other Church leaders.

To understand the Investiture Controversy, we need to understand the
nature of a medieval bishop's power and authority. A bishop in medieval
Europe was a Church leader, with a cathedral church and a palace. A
medieval bishop would also hold lands with fiefs on these lands (and
military obligations from those who held these fiefs), just like any
great noble.

The Holy Roman Emperors believed that they had the right to appoint
bishops because a bishop held lands from the emperor and because the
emperors believed themselves to be the leaders of all Christendom. The
reforming popes of the eleventh century, particularly Pope Gregory VII
(r. 1073--1085), objected to this belief. These popes believed that,
since their authority as popes came from God, their spiritual authority
was superior to the earthly authority of any king or prince. They
further claimed their right to be independent rulers of the Papal States
in Central Italy, based on the Donation of Constantine (see Chapter
Seven).

Gregory VII was up against a man just as strong willed as he in the
person of Emperor Henry IV (r. 1056--1106). From 1075, their
relationship became increasingly adversarial as each claimed the
exclusive right to appoint and depose bishops. Eventually, their dispute
burst into open conflict when Henry claimed that Gregory was in fact not
rightfully pope at all and attempted to appoint his own pope. In
response, Gregory proclaimed that none of Henry's subjects had a duty to
obey him and encouraged his subjects to rise in rebellion.

Without the Church to legitimate Henry IV, his empire collapsed into
civil war. As a result, Henry took a small band of followers and, in the
dead of winter, crossed the Alps, braving the snowy, ice-covered passes
to negotiate with the pope in person. In January, he approached the
mountain castle of Canossa where the pope was staying and begged Gregory
for forgiveness, waiting outside of the pope's castle on his knees in
the snow for three days. Finally, Pope Gregory forgave the emperor.

After a public ceremony of reconciliation, Henry returned to Central
Europe and crushed the rebellion. He and his army then marched on Italy,
forcing Gregory VII into exile. The Investiture Controversy would drag
on for another four decades. In the end, the Holy Roman Emperors and
popes would reach a compromise with the 1122 **Concordat of Worms**. The
compromise was that clergy would choose bishops but that the emperor
could decide disputed elections. A bishop would receive his lands from
the emperor in one ceremony and the emblems of his spiritual authority
from the pope in another. Other kings of Western Europe reached similar
compromises with the papacy.

The results of half a century of papal reform efforts were mixed. The
Catholic and Orthodox Churches had split with one another, and tensions
remain between the two today. Although the popes failed to achieve
everything they sought, they did gain limited independence for the
Church, and they succeeded almost completely in ending the practice of
simony. Indeed, one contrast between Western Europe and much of the rest
of the world is a strong sense of separation between secular and sacred
authority. That separation of Church and state owes much to the troubled
years of the Investiture Controversy.

The successes of the papacy in their efforts at Church reform, together
with the military successes seen by Christians in the Western
Mediterranean against Muslims, would inspire the popes to an even more
ambitious effort: the Crusades.

## 12.12 THE CRUSADES

### 12.12.1 Background: Disaster at Manzikert

On the surface, the Byzantine Empire of the eleventh century looked like
one of the world's great powers. It dominated the Eastern Mediterranean.
And its emperors reigned from Constantinople, a city full of magnificent
churches, splendid palaces, and centuries-old monuments of an ancient
empire.

But these outward signs of strength concealed several weaknesses. In the
first place, the *theme* system (see Chapter Seven) had begun to break
down. The plots of land used to equip soldiers had gradually given way
to large estates held by powerful aristocrats. These powerful
aristocrats often paid less and less in taxes, starving the state of key
resources. The *theme* soldiers themselves were used less often, and
when they did fight, they were often poorly trained and equipped. The
emperors relied on mercenaries for most of their fighting. The civilian
aristocracy and the military were often at loggerheads.

The Byzantine emperors of the later eleventh century were nevertheless
able to hold their own against external threats until the arrival of the
Saljuq Turks in the Middle East (see Chapters Eight and Eleven). Both
the Byzantine emperor Romanos IV (r. 1068--1071) and the Saljuq sultan
Alps Arslan (r. 1063--1072) sought to control the Caucasus Mountains,
whose passes controlled access to the Middle East from the Central Asian
steppes. Control of this route was especially important as the steppes
served as a source from which the Turks in the Middle East could recruit
more fighters. Byzantine and Turk finally clashed. Romanos sought to
break the Turkish threat on his eastern flank and so mustered an immense
army. This army consisted [of]{style="font-size: 1em;"} both soldiers of
the *themes* and mercenary units drawn from many different peoples:
Western Europeans, Cumans and Pechenegs from the steppes, Scandinavians,
and Turks. The complexity of this army and the dysfunctional politics of
the Byzantine Empire would prove to be Romanos's undoing.

On 19 August 1071, the forces of the Byzantine Empire and the Great
Saljuq Empire met at the Battle of Manzikert near the shores of Lake Van
in Armenia. The thematic troops were of indifferent quality, but worse
for the emperor was the treachery of both the Byzantine commander
Andronikos Doukas and the Byzantine force's Turkic mercenaries. The
Byzantine field army was annihilated. The emperor himself was surrounded
and taken captive after his elite guard of Norse mercenaries went down
fighting in his defense.

The result was a catastrophe for the Empire. Most of the Byzantine Army
had been wiped out. Worse, competing Byzantine nobles took advantage of
the emperor's captivity to launch their own bids for power. During the
decade of civil war that followed, most of the Empire's holdings in Asia
Minor fell under the dominion of the Turks. Once the world's most
powerful Christian state, the Byzantine Empire now faced destruction.

</figure>

Eventually, Alexios Komnenos (r. 1081--1118) would seize control of the
Byzantine Empire and laboriously rebuild its military strength. Alexios
was an able and clever military commander who also possessed good
long-term sense. He used the tax base of the Empire's Balkan possessions
to fund a new army, one composed largely of foreign mercenaries and a
small core of Greek soldiers. These indigenous soldiers were often
granted blocks of lands known as ***pronoiai*** (singular ***pronoia***)
whose revenues they would use to equip themselves and their soldiers. A
*pronoia* was much like a fief. Komnenos recruited steppe peoples, such
as the Cumans and Pechenegs, into his forces. He also recruited
mercenaries from Western Europe, particularly the Holy Roman Empire and
West Francia. In March of 1095, Komnenos sent a request to the pope for
military assistance. The long-term consequences of this request would be
earth-shaking.

### 12.12.2 The First Crusade

The pope who received Alexios Komnenos's request for help was Urban II
(r. 1088--1099), an associate of reformers like Gregory VII. Violence
was common in Western Europe, particularly France. Reformers sought ways
to quell this violence, which was usually the fault of knights. Such
reformers wanted to turn the aggression of knights to pursuits that were
useful to Christian society, rather than destructive of civilian life.
Fighting against Muslims in Sicily and Spain showed the popes an example
of knightly aggression directed towards Christendom's external enemies
(see Chapter Eight).

In addition, the Church had long recognized Roman Law's concept of
**Just** **War**: a war could be moral if it was defensive, declared by
a rightful authority, and likely to cause less damage than if the war
had not occurred. By the eleventh century, certain churchmen had further
formulated this idea into one of **Holy War**: a war fought in defense
of the Church could  be not only morally right but even meritorious.

</figure>

The final element that captured Pope Urban II's attention was the idea
of Jerusalem. According to Christian tradition, Jerusalem was where
Jesus Christ was crucified, died, and rose from the dead (see Chapter
Six). As such, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built on the empty tomb
of Christ, was the holiest Church in the Christian world. And this
Church had been under the control of Muslims since Caliph Umar's
conquest of Palestine in the seventh century (see Chapter Eight). The
city remained important to Christians. Even while it was under Muslim
rule, Christians traveled there as **pilgrims**---that is, travelers
undertaking a journey for religious purposes.

Pope Urban thus conceived of the idea of using the military force of
Western Europe to strengthen the flagging Byzantine Empire (a Christian
state) and to return Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher to
Christian rule. On 27 November 1095, he gathered several of the major
nobles of Western Europe (as well as many lower-ranked knights) for an
open-air sermon at Clermont, where he was presiding over a Church
council. In this sermon, Urban II proclaimed that it was the duty of
these warrior aristocrats, as Christians, to defend the Byzantine Empire
and to put the city of Jerusalem under Christian rule. The knights
responded with enthusiasm. They are said to have cried out, "God wills
it!" and to have vowed to set off to Jerusalem and bring it under
Christian rule. Furthermore, as word of Pope Urban's admonition spread
throughout Western Europe, more and more of the knightly class answered
the call, mustering under the leadership of several powerful nobles.

This movement of the knights of most of Western Europe to fight against
Muslims in the Middle East is generally known as the first of a series
of **Crusades.** A crusade was a war declared by the papacy against
those perceived to be enemies of the Christian faith (usually, but not
always, Muslims). Participating in a crusade would grant a Christian
forgiveness of sins. We ought to note that such a concept in many ways
superficially resembled the Muslim notion of the Lesser Jihad (see
Chapter Eight).

As these forces mustered and marched south and east, the religious
enthusiasm accompanying them often spilled out into aggression against
non-Christians other than Muslims. One group of Crusaders in the area
around the Rhine engaged in a series of massacres of Jewish civilians,
traveling from city to city while killing Jews and looting their
possessions before this armed gang was forced to disperse.

The Crusaders traveled in two main waves. The first traveled to the
Byzantine Empire, where it was ferried across the Bosporus and wiped out
by a Turkish army. The second wave, however, was better planned and
coordinated. Upon arrival in the Byzantine Empire, it reached an uneasy
truce with Alexios Komnenos, who had been expecting a modest force of
mercenaries (not the armed might of most of Western Europe). The
Crusaders were fortunate. After Nizaris had assassinated Nizam al-Mulk
and the Fatimid caliph of Egypt had died (both in 1092), the Middle East
fell into political chaos (see Chapter Eight). When the Crusaders
marched east in 1096, they encountered not a unified Great Saljuq Empire
but a collection of independent and semi-independent sultans and emirs.

The Crusaders moved east, winning a string of victories in Asia Minor.
When they could not be outmaneuvered, the armored knights of Western
Europe often stood at an advantage against the lightly armored or
unarmored mounted archers that made up the bulk of Turkish forces.
Following the path of the crusading army, Alexios was able to restore
much of western Asia Minor to the control of the Byzantine Empire,
although the central Anatolian plateau would remain under the dominion
of the Saljuq Turks. The Crusaders advanced on Antioch, the largest and
most prosperous city of the Levant. After a siege of nearly a year, they
seized control of the city and defeated a Turkish army that attempted to
relieve it. The Crusader army then marched south to Jerusalem and into
territory controlled by the Fatimid caliphate---itself a Shi'ite state
that was no friend of the Sunni Saljuq Turks. Venice and Genoa,
meanwhile, transported supplies to the Crusaders by sea. The Crusaders
rejected Fatimid overtures for a negotiated settlement and, in June
1099, arrived outside the walls of Jerusalem. The Crusaders stormed and
brutally sacked the city. Both the city's defenders and its civilian
population were subject to bloody slaughter. We must note that there was
nothing particularly unique about this massacre. The custom among many
pre-modern peoples was to sack and massacre a city that resisted
conquest.

After the fall of Jerusalem, the Crusaders established four states in
the Levant: the County of Edessa, in northern Mesopotamia; the
Principality of Antioch, centered on the city of Antioch and its
environs; the County of Tripoli, in what is now Lebanon; and the Kingdom
of Jerusalem, which occupied Palestine and whose capital was the city of
Jerusalem. These states were ruled by men (and often women) who were
Catholic in religion and ethnically Western European. The religion and
institutions of these **Crusader** **States** were nearly the same as
those of Western Europe.

These states attracted some settlers, in both their warrior aristocracy
and even merchants and peasants. But many of the subjects of the
Christian rulers of these kingdoms were Muslims. Others included
Christian Arabs, who had special privileges over their Muslim
counterparts but fewer rights than Catholic, ethnically Western European
Christians. Indeed, the Crusader States would consistently suffer from a
lack of manpower. Although the pope had spoken of rich lands for the
taking in Palestine, most of the knights who joined the First Crusade
(and survived) returned to Western Europe. The Crusader States relied on
extensive networks of heavily fortified stone castles for defense. They
were fortunate that the Middle East was politically fragmented and
Fatimid Egypt was weak. Whether these states would be sustainable in the
face of stronger Muslim powers remained to be seen.

In the twelfth century, many of Europe's kingdoms saw a gradual
centralization of state power. England had long been Western Europe's
most centralized state. In 1066, a group of Normans under their Duke,
William the Bastard, invaded England. William defeated the English army,
making himself the king of England: he was thus known as William the
Conqueror. This conquest of England by French-speakers moved the
culture, language, and institutions of England closer to those of
France. Although England looked more feudal, it nevertheless retained a
centralized bureaucratic apparatus. William was able to use this
bureaucracy to conduct a nationwide census, a feat no European state
outside of the Byzantine Empire could accomplish. England would suffer
civil war for nearly a decade and a half in the twelfth century. For the
most part, though, its monarchs were innovative and clever
administrators---particularly Henry I (r. 1100--1135) and Henry II (r.
1154--1189). English accomplishments included the creation of a network
of royal courts and a sophisticated office of tax collection known as
the **Exchequer**.

France entered the tenth and eleventh centuries as the most
loosely-governed kingdom of Europe. In 987, France's nobles elected Hugh
Capet, the count of Paris, as king, effectively replacing the
Carolingian dynasty. The **Capetian** Dynasty's kings, however, directly
controlled only the lands around Paris. In addition, after the Norman
conquest of England in 1066, the Norman kings of England were also dukes
of large French territories. Thus, for the first part of the twelfth
century, much of France was under the effective control of the English
crown.

In spite of these challenges, the Capetian monarchs gradually built
their kingdom into a functional state. They cultivated a reputation as
defenders of Christianity to gain legitimacy from the Church, and they
enforced the feudal obligations that powerful nobles owed to the crown.
The Capetians often called on nobles to serve militarily, helping create
a habit of obedience to the king.

To the southwest, the rise of the Muslim Almoravid Empire under the rule
of aggressively expansionist Muslim religious reformers in North Africa
briefly put the *Reconquista* in jeopardy. By the early twelfth century,
though, it had resumed, with the Muslim stronghold of Zaragoza falling
to Christian armies in 1118. After the First Crusade, those knights who
traveled to Spain to help its Christian kings fight Muslims received the
same forgiveness of sins that the papacy granted to crusaders in the
Levant. Over the twelfth century, four major Christian kingdoms emerged
in the Iberian Peninsula: Portugal, Leon-Castile, Navarre, and Aragon.
These kingdoms developed a sophisticated system of taxation to fund the
*Reconquista*. In the later twelfth century, they faced the challenge of
the Almohad Empire that emerged from the Islamic Maghreb to unite Muslim
Spain and North Africa. By the 1150s, Christian Spain was on the
defensive once again.

In Scandinavia, too, a set of strong monarchies had emerged in Denmark
and Norway by the end of the twelfth century.

## 12.14 EMPIRES: RECOVERY AND COLLAPSE

### 12.14.1 Frederick Barbarossa and the Holy Roman Empire

The Investiture Controversy weakened the power of the Holy Roman
Emperors. In the early part of the twelfth century, power in the Holy
Roman Empire decentralized in the same way that it had in tenth- and
eleventh-century France. The cities of Northern Italy were increasingly
governing themselves with little direct authority exercised by the Holy
Roman Emperors. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (r.
1152--1190) sought to arrest this decline and make his subjects adhere
to his authority.

Frederick's two overriding goals were to ensure that the great princes
of Central Europe and the city-states of Northern Italy acknowledged and
submitted to his authority. Northern Italy was a particularly vexing
challenge. By the middle of the twelfth century, many of the cities of
Northern Italy had gradually moved from rule by an urban nobility or
bishops to self-government by an elected commune. These communes were
often reluctant to acknowledge imperial authority, especially with
respect to the taxes that Barbarossa believed were owed him. Shortly
after beginning his reign, Barbarossa sought to implement this
authority.

Barbarossa had a great deal of initial success, but eventually, the
city-states of Northern Italy united into an organization called the
Lombard League. This League allied with the popes, who lent their moral
authority to the cause of the northern Italian city-states. Indeed, one
of the difficulties faced by Barbarossa was that any pope would prefer
to keep Northern and Central Italy out of the direct control of the Holy
Roman Emperors. If the emperors were too powerful in Northern and
Central Italy, then they would threaten the papacy's independence,
jeopardizing everything the eleventh-century reforming popes had
struggled to accomplish. Eventually, this coalition of the papacy and
Lombard League inflicted a military defeat on Barbarossa at the 1176
Battle of Legnano, after which Barbarossa was forced to concede a great
deal of self-rule within the Empire to the Italian city-states.

Near the end of his reign, Barbarossa would lead an immense army on a
crusade. In 1187, the kings of Western Europe found themselves forced to
respond to a great catastrophe for Christendom: the city and, indeed,
most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem had fallen to a Muslim army under the
sultan Saladin. These kings responded with the effort known as the Third
Crusade.

### 12.14.2 The Komnenoi in Byzantium

The other empire claiming (with somewhat more justice) to be the
rightful heir of the Roman Empire was the Byzantine Empire. After the
disaster of Manzikert, the Komnenos emperors had managed to rebuild a
Byzantine army based on the system of *pronoiai* and mercenary forces.
Emperor John II (r. 1118--1143) built on Alexios's accomplishments. He
established effective Byzantine control over much of Western Anatolia,
consolidated imperial hold on Southeastern Europe, and, indeed, forced
the Crusader States to acknowledge him as their overlord.

</figure>

At the same time that Barbarossa sought to build the Holy Roman Empire
as a credible power, Manuel Komnenos (r. 1143--1180) sought to do the
same with his Empire. He managed to suppress the growing power of Venice
in the Eastern Mediterranean, form an alliance with the growing kingdom
of Hungary, and temporarily force the Turks of central Anatolia to
acknowledge his overlordship. In the end, however, the emperor's reach
exceeded his grasp. His attempt to conquer Fatimid Egypt in alliance
with the Kingdom of Jerusalem failed when the military commander of
Damascus, Saladin, outmaneuvered both Byzantium and Jerusalem. Saladin
instead added Egypt to the territory of Damascus, which created a Muslim
Empire in the Middle East that menaced the Crusader States (see Chapter
Eight). And the emperor's effort to return central Anatolia to Byzantine
rule ultimately failed when his army was defeated by the Saljuq
Sultanate of Rum at Myriokephalon in 1176. Ultimately, the Byzantine
Empire's undoing was not necessarily in individual battles. Rather, the
loss of the wealthy agricultural land of Central Anatolia to the Turks
meant that the Byzantine emperors never quite had the tax base necessary
to put their ambitions of a restored Roman Empire into practice.

In the end, the Komnenoi had managed to restore the Byzantine Empire as
a regional power, but it was left with structural weaknesses that would
eventually prove to be its undoing.

## 12.15 THE TWELFTH-CENTURY RENAISSANCE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The twelfth century in Western Europe was a time of renewed vibrancy in
intellectual activity, and much of this activity centered on Europe's
towns and cities. We call this renewal of intellectual activity the
**Twelfth-Century Renaissance**. Both monasteries and cathedrals were
centers of education in Western Europe, even during the dark days of the
tenth century. Over the eleventh century, thinkers in the monasteries of
Western Europe had increasingly sought to apply the tools of logic (in
particular, Aristotelian logic) to the study of the Bible. But Western
Europeans were familiar with very little of Aristotle's work aside from
a small number of logical writings that had been translated from Greek
into Latin in the sixth century. The twelfth century would see a massive
shift, with an immense growth of interest in philosophy on the part of
those men (and a few women) who had a formal education. The spur to this
interest would come from events in Southwestern Europe.

Al-Andalus had been a major source of Muslim intellectual activity. As
early as the tenth century, Christian scholars, such as Gerbert of
Aurillac (who eventually became Pope Sylvester
II,[^\[2\]^](#chapter-012-unknown-9.xhtml_footnote-548-2 "Between the sixth and eleventh centuries, a practice emerged whereby the pope would adopt a distinct name from the name he was born with upon ascension to the papacy. The practice continues to the present day."){#chapter-012-unknown-9.xhtml_return-footnote-548-2
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 2"} r. 999--1003), had visited
Muslim-ruled Spain to read Ancient Greek works that were unavailable
elsewhere in Western Europe. Gerbert's writings show him to be
particularly fascinated with Euclid, Arabic numerals, and the concept of
zero.

When Toledo fell to Christian armies in 1085, its libraries became
available to the larger Christian world. Muslims had translated most of
the philosophy of Aristotle into Arabic in addition to writing extensive
original works that engaged with the thought of Aristotle and Plato.
Once these books were in Christian hands, Raymond, archbishop of Toledo
(r. 1125--1152), set up translation teams. People who spoke Arabic and
the Romance languages of Spain would first translate these books into
Spanish, and these books would then be translated into Latin, which
would thus make Aristotle and Ptolemy (as well as the works of Arabic
philosophers) available to educated people throughout Western Europe.
The availability of texts that had been largely known only by reputation
spurred an intellectual revolution, as Christian thinkers sought to
understand how to reconcile an understanding of the world based on
Christianity with the approach of the non-Christian Ancient Greeks.

</figure>

Such translations on the Christian/Muslim frontier continued through the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Christendom thus had access to the
writings of Muslim philosophers. Western Europeans read natural
philosophy, such as al-Haytham's writings on optics and the Aristotelian
commentaries of Ibn Rushd (whose name they pronounced as Averroës). This
movement saw the translation not only of philosophy but also of
medicine. Indeed, in the Muslim world, philosophers often served as
physicians---so the medical works of philosophers and physicians such as
Ibn Sina (Avicenna) were read avidly by Christians in Western Europe.

Philosophy and medicine were not the only fields of study to receive
attention. Western Europeans also showed a renewed interest in law. The
kingdoms that had grown up in Western Europe after the fall of the
Western Roman Empire had incorporated some elements of Roman Law as well
as the oral law of the Germanic peoples into their legal systems. For
the most part, though, their law codes were unsystematic. Starting from
the eleventh century, scholars, particularly those based in the schools
of Bologna, began subjecting the Justinian Code (see Chapter Seven) to
intense study, using logical analysis to create a body of systematic
writing on the interpretation of law. Men who studied Roman Law would
often go to work for kings and emperors, with the result that much
European law would draw its inspiration from Justinian.

Most schools were still attached to cathedral churches. Indeed, these
schools in which medicine, law, and philosophy flourished as disciplines
of study might be compared to the madrassas of the Muslim world. The
chief field of study in these schools was theology---that is, the
interpretation of the Bible. And theologians increasingly drew on
logical analysis and philosophy of language to understand what they
believed was God's revelation to humanity.

Eventually, many of these cathedral schools gained the right to organize
as self-governing institutions. We call these institutions
**universities**. By the end of the twelfth century, the universities of
Bologna (est. 1088), Paris (1150), and Oxford (1167) had become
self-governing institutions and would serve as the foundation of the
university system of the Western world that exists to the present day.

## 12.16 THE THIRD CRUSADE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The Crusader States had endured from 1099 to 1187 because the Muslim
Middle East was politically fragmented. Once Saladin had overthrown
Egypt's Fatimid Caliphate and united Egypt to Muslim-controlled Syria
and northern Iraq (see Chapter Eight), he was able to turn his resources
to destroying the Crusader States. Eventually, at the 1187 Battle of
Hattin, his forces met the combined forces of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
The result was a complete victory for Saladin. With the manpower of most
of the Kingdom of Jerusalem killed or captured---knights and noble
prisoners would be held for a hefty ransom, while lower-ranked soldiers
would go to slave markets---Saladin was able to capture most of the
castles and cities that made up the kingdom, including the city of
Jerusalem itself.

</figure>

The result shocked the Christian world, and Pope Gregory VIII quickly
issued the **papal bull** (that is, an official papal pronouncement)
*Audita* *tremendi*, which called on the Christian world to retake
Jerusalem. The kings of England and France, Richard I (known as
Lionheart, r. 1189--1199) and Philip Augustus (r. 1180--1223),
respectively, took vows to launch a crusade, as did Holy Roman Emperor
Frederick Barbarossa. The Christians of Iberia took little part in
crusades in the Levant, as their efforts focused on the *Reconquista.*

Although Frederick Barbarossa died en route (he drowned in a stream in
the mountains of Anatolia), both Richard I and Philip Augustus
eventually arrived in the Levant by sea. Philip soon returned to France,
but King Richard battled Saladin over the course of two years. The
results were mostly inconclusive. The crusading army seized most of the
castles and cities on the coast, and these became the center for a
restored but smaller Kingdom of Jerusalem, but the Crusaders ultimately
failed to take Jerusalem itself. The Crusade finally ended in a truce in
which both parties ratified this state of affairs, with Christian
pilgrims allowed to visit the city of Jerusalem, even though it remained
under Muslim rule.

## 12.17 THE FOURTH CRUSADE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

While Jerusalem remained under Muslim control, the papacy's goal was to
retake it. This was especially true after 1198, as the man elected pope
that year was one of the most ambitious men to wear the papal crown:
Pope Innocent III (r. 1198--1216). Innocent's goals were to morally
reform society and to launch a crusade for retaking the holy city of
Jerusalem. In the year of his election, he issued a call to crusade. It
ended in disaster.

Between 1185 and 1204, the Byzantine Empire had drastically weakened.
After the death of Manuel Komnenos with his heir still a child, the
Empire faced a string of catastrophes. The child-emperor was murdered;
his successor was eventually overthrown; and the next emperor after that
was likewise overthrown. During this chaotic period, the peripheral
territories of Serbia, Cyprus, and Cilicia seceded. Closer to the
center, the Bulgars rose in rebellion in 1186 and re-established an
independent Bulgaria, only a few days' march from Constantinople itself.
In addition, the chain of emperors, regents, and usurpers reigning
between 1185 and 1204 had allowed the Byzantine navy to gradually
disintegrate.

In 1202, a group of crusaders (with kings notably absent) contracted
with the government of Venice to transport them to fight in Egypt, now
ruled by Saladin's heirs. When these crusaders proved unable to pay, the
Venetian government requested their military assistance. The son of the
deposed Byzantine emperor (whose eyes had been gouged out) approached
the crusaders and Venetians. He offered the crusaders military and
financial assistance, and he offered trading privileges to the
Venetians. In exchange, he asked the two parties to help him regain his
throne. The end result was that, in 1204, after a series of
misadventures, a crusader army stormed the walls of Constantinople and
brutally sacked the city. Then, the crusaders parceled out much of the
territory of the Byzantine Empire amongst themselves. The most
advantageous ports went to Venice, which would use them as the basis of
a Mediterranean trading empire that would endure for centuries. The
Crusades, which began with an appeal for help by the Byzantine Empire,
ultimately resulted in its destruction.

Although the Byzantine Empire had been broken up, three states survived
that claimed to be legitimate heirs to the Byzantine state. One was
established in Western Anatolia with its capital in Nicaea, another in
Epirus (present-day Albania), while the third was based on the city of
Trebizond, on the northern coast of Anatolia. The Nicene Empire would
eventually retake Constantinople in 1261, although the restored state
would never be the regional power that the Empire had been under the
Komnenoi.

## 12.18 THE STATES OF THIRTEENTH-CENTURY EUROPE

### 12.18.1 Eastern Europe

The thirteenth century would prove catastrophic for both Hungary and the
Kyivan Rus, for the same Mongols who laid waste to much of Asia would
eventually arrive on the plains of Eastern Europe (see Chapter Eleven).
In 1240, the Mongols shattered the Kyivan Rus, destroyed the city of
Kyiv, and left the plains around the city littered with dead bodies
stretching to the horizon. The Rus would remain Mongol vassals for the
rest of the Middle Ages. In 1241, at the Battle of Mohi, the Mongols
annihilated a Hungarian army. The Mongols subsequently killed half the
kingdom's population before Batu Khan, the Mongol commander, returned to
Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan (see Chapter Eleven).

### 12.18.2 The Holy Roman Empire: Failure of Frederick II

The Holy Roman Empire remained Europe's dominant power in the first half
of the thirteenth century. The Empire would, however, be fatally
undermined by the struggles between Emperor Frederick II (r. 1215--1250)
and a series of mostly forceful and able popes. The dispute was the same
as that which had occupied his grandfather, Frederick Barbarossa. Unlike
Barbarossa, the base of Frederick II's power was in Sicily, in Southern
Italy. His father, Henry VI (r. 1190--1197), had married Constance,
queen of Sicily. This made Frederick II ruler of both the Holy Roman
Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily. Like his grandfather, he sought to
create an empire that ruled both Italy and Central Europe. Like their
predecessors, the popes and the cities of Northern Italy opposed this
effort. In the end, when Frederick II died, the Holy Roman Empire
collapsed as a unitary state. For nearly twenty years, it had no
emperor. The papacy's allies hunted down and brutally slaughtered
Frederick's heirs. By the time an emperor was elected from the Austrian
nobles of the Hapsburg family in 1273, the Empire was more a loose
collection of states than a centralized empire.

### 12.18.3 Expansion of Christendom on the Frontiers

To the northeast, Christendom continued to expand. In the forests and
bogs around the Baltic Sea, German-speaking crusaders (as well as Danes)
conquered the
heathen[^\[3\]^](#chapter-012-unknown-9.xhtml_footnote-548-3 "Generally, we refer to the followers of the Greco-Roman religion that prevailed before Christianity as pagans and the followers of the northern European religion that prevailed before Christianity as heathens."){#chapter-012-unknown-9.xhtml_return-footnote-548-3
.footnote aria-label="Footnote 3"} peoples, converting them to
Christianity and settling the territory with Germans and Danes. These
efforts were recognized by the popes as crusades. By the end of the
thirteenth century, all of Europe except for Lithuania was Christian.
The kingdom of Lithuania would remain resolutely heathen and militarily
resist German Crusaders until 1385, at which time the Lithuanian kings
finally converted to Christianity when their kingdom was combined with
Poland.

In thirteenth-century Spain, the most significant accomplishment of the
Christian monarchs was that, on 16 July 1212, at the Battle of Las Navas
de Tolosa, the combined armies of Castile, Aragon, Portugal, and Navarre
met those of the Almohad Caliphate and won a victory so crushing that
the power of the Almohads was forever broken. In the decades that
followed, Aragon, Portugal, and Castile conquered all of Muslim Iberia,
save for Granada.

### 12.18.4 France and England

Perhaps the most successful thirteenth-century monarchs were the
Capetian kings of France. In the years between 1203 and 1214, King
Philip Augustus managed to dispossess the English king of almost all of
his territory held in France. He was also increasingly successful in
using a set of recognized laws to enhance his legitimacy. He made sure
that he had a strong legal case drawn up by expert lawyers before he
dispossessed England's King John. Likewise, he created a royal court
that was a court of final appeal---and that meant that, even in parts of
the kingdom where great lords exercised their own justice, the king had
increasing authority. In 1208, Pope Innocent III called a crusade
against the semi-independent territories of southern France because they
were home to a group of heretics known as the Cathars. In the resulting
crusade (called the **Albigensian Crusade** because much of the fighting
happened around the town of Albi), crusaders from the north crushed the
power of the great nobles of southern France. King Louis VIII (r.
1223--1226) then extended the direct rule of the French crown into areas
where, for centuries, the French kings had ruled only indirectly.

France's King Louis IX (r. 1226--1270) was perhaps the most effective
Capetian king. He continued the process of establishing the royal courts
as supreme in the kingdom. It was in Louis IX's reign that we can see
the beginnings of a sophisticated and accurate royal budget.

</figure>

When England's King John (r. 1199--1216) lost to Philip Augustus, his
outraged nobles rebelled, resulting in a civil war from 1215 to 1217. In
1215, during the civil war, England's nobles forced King John to sign a
treaty known as the **Magna Carta**. This treaty would have much greater
impact than anyone who drafted it could have foreseen. The Magna Carta
required the king to seek the consent of the English realm before
raising taxes. This was to be done by convening a council. The convening
of such councils, known as **parliaments**, would come to be
systematized over the course of the thirteenth century. By the reign of
Edward I (r. 1272--1307), they would have representatives from most
regions of England and would vote on whether to grant taxes to the king.
Parliaments were not unique to England, however. Most Spanish kings
would consult with a body known as a ***cortes***, with representatives
of both Spain's towns and nobility, and the Scandinavian kings had
assemblies called **things.** Indeed, by 1356, the Holy Roman Emperor
would be elected by an assembly of the Holy Roman Empire's greatest
nobles, known as electors. England's parliaments, however, would
gradually evolve from assemblies convoked when a king wanted to raise
taxes to a regular assembly that gave representative voice to the people
of England.

As stated earlier, of thirteenth-century Europe's monarchs, France's
Capetian kings were some of the most successful. Indeed, King Louis IX's
French state was well-administered enough that he was able to manage the
logistics of a military campaign fought at the opposite end of the
Mediterranean. Modern historians often call this conflict the Seventh
Crusade.

## 12.19 LATER CRUSADES AND CRUSADING'S ULTIMATE FAILURE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

After the Third Crusade, the re-established Crusader States managed to
survive and even expand in power for the next several decades. Syria and
Egypt were split between Saladin's heirs, and the crusader kingdoms
often enjoyed good relations with Ayyubid Egypt: indeed, a truce worked
out between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and the Egyptian sultan
al-Kamil in 1229 resulted in the city of Jerusalem itself returning to
Christian rule.

</figure>

In the 1240s, however, forces far from the Levant brought down the
Kingdom of Jerusalem. As the Mongols gradually conquered Central Asia
(see Chapter Eleven), the Khwarazmian Turks were driven from their realm
in the steppes into Syria and northern Iraq. They ended up allying with
Ayyubid Egypt against the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and in 1244,
the combined armies of Damascus and Jerusalem were defeated by an
Egyptian/Khwarazmian army. Jerusalem fell under Muslim rule, under which
it would remain until 1917.

In response to the fall of Jerusalem, Pope Innocent IV (r. 1243--1254)
called a crusade that would be led by King Louis IX. While it had
contingents from other Western European kingdoms, this effort was
primarily an effort of the French crown. Although King Louis IX was able
to manage the impressive logistical feat of organizing and equipping an
army that seized the northern Egyptian port of Damietta, the effort to
take all of Egypt was ultimately unsuccessful. Over the course of 1250,
the French army was surrounded in the swamps of the Nile Delta outside
of Cairo and forced to surrender, with Louis himself captured. During
the fighting, the Ayyubid sultan's Mamluks launched a coup d'état and
seized power in Egypt. As a result, this created in Egypt a military
power that would dominate the Levant for nearly three centuries (see
Chapter Eight).

Indeed, in the four decades after Louis's failure in the Nile Delta, the
Mamluk sultans of Egypt conquered all of the Crusader States. The last
crusader stronghold in the Levant, the city of Acre, fell in 1291.
Although Popes would still call crusades for military efforts against
Muslim forces (and indeed, still make calls to retake the city of
Jerusalem), crusading had failed. One reason for crusading's ultimate
failure: as Western European kings consolidated their power, they often
had priorities other than crusading. England's Edward I, for example,
spent a few months fighting in the Levant in 1271. He spent most of his
reign fighting to subdue England's neighboring kingdoms of Wales and
Scotland.

In the end, the Crusades failed, and their greatest long-term impacts
were the destruction of the Byzantine Empire and the growth of the sea
power of Genoa and Venice, whose ships and sailors had transported
people and supplies between Europe and the Crusader States.

## 12.20 SCHOLASTICISM {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

As more and more works of Ancient Greek and Muslim philosophy became
available to Western European Christians, the question of how to
understand the world acquired more urgency. The philosophers of the
Ancient Greek and Muslim worlds were known to have produced much useful
knowledge. But they had not been Christians. How, asked many thinkers,
were Christians to understand the world: through divine revelation, as
it appeared in the Bible, or through the human reason of philosophers?
Indeed, this question was reminiscent of similar questions taking place
in the Islamic world, when thinkers such as al-Ghazali questioned how
useful the tools of logic and philosophy were in understanding the Quran
(see Chapter Eight).

This controversy had raged since at least the twelfth century, when
certain devout monks had said, "Whoever seeks to make Aristotle a
Christian makes himself a heretic." Out of this controversy, medieval
Europe produced its greatest thinker, St. Thomas Aquinas (1224--1274).
St. Thomas was a Dominican **friar**. Friars were those churchmen who,
like monks, took vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. Instead of
living in isolated monasteries, though, friars spent much of their time
preaching to laypeople in Europe's growing towns and cities. These
friars, whose two major groups were the Franciscans and Dominicans, had
schools in most major universities of Western Europe by the early
thirteenth century. Aquinas, a philosopher in the Dominican school of
the University of Paris, argued that human reason and divine revelation
were in perfect harmony. He did so based on the techniques of the
disputed question. He would raise a point, raise its objection, then
provide an answer, and this answer would always be based on a logical
argument. Aquinas was part of a larger movement in the universities of
Western Europe, which focused on using logic to reconcile Christian
theology with human reason. We call this movement **scholasticism**.

Aquinas and the scholastics can be compared to Zhu Xi and the
neo-Confucians of Song China. Just as Zhu Xi sought to integrate
Confucian thought with Buddhist and Daoist philosophy, so also Aquinas
sought to integrate both Aristotelian logic and Christian theology.

The period [saw successes ]{style="font-size: 1em;"}not only in the
field of speculative philosophy and theology but also in the practical
application of science. The master masons who designed Western Europe's
castles and churches built hundreds of soaring cathedrals. These would
be the tallest buildings in Europe for six hundred years. Many of these
cathedrals were examples of **Gothic** architecture. Gothic cathedrals
were known for the use of pointed arches that allowed taller buildings
and for stained-glass windows that admitted a dazzling array of light.
These cathedrals were made possible by the prosperity of Europe's towns,
whose governing councils often financed the construction of magnificent
churches.

Thirteenth-century Europe showed other developments in technology as
well. In 1269, Pierre of Harincourt first came to understand the
principles of magnetic poles based on an analysis of the magnetic
compass (in use since the twelfth century). At the same time, between
1286 and 1306, based on the pre-existing technology of lens-grinding,
Western Europeans invented eyeglasses. Water clocks had been known
throughout the world since ancient times, but in the years between 1271
and 1300, Western Europeans invented the mechanical clock.

In the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, Western Europeans
gradually adapted the art of **alchemy**, the art of changing (or
attempting to change) one element into another, from the Muslim world.
Eventually, alchemists (and natural philosophers who studied alchemy)
would find new techniques of refining and compounding chemicals. Their
ultimate goal---the ability to turn base metals into gold---would
unfortunately never succeed.

In addition to these technologies invented or improved in medieval
Europe, the Mongol Empire's trade routes allowed for the importation of
East Asian technologies like gunpowder.

## 12.21 DAILY LIFE AT THE MEDIEVAL ZENITH {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Even at the height of medieval Europe's prosperity, most people were
peasant farmers, living like their ancestors in the Carolingian or
Byzantine Empires. They often lived in villages in one- or two-room
houses with separate space for livestock. Only the richest of
peasants---and some free peasants did prosper---could afford a bed. Most
people slept in straw. The only furniture in a typical peasant household
might be a table and stool. The peasant diet was mainly grain, both
bread and porridge, with protein from both legumes and eggs. The
occasional meat came from chickens, sheep that were too old for
shearing, and sometimes pigs. Beef was reserved for nobles.

<figure id="attachment_534" class="wp-caption aligncenter"

</figure>

Nobles often lived in large rural houses. They were sometimes attached
to castles, but many castles were unoccupied in times of peace. The
noble diet was heavy in meat; indeed, nobles often suffered from gout, a
painful swelling of the joints from too much meat in the diet. Meat
dishes were lavishly cooked in spices, like cardamom, cinnamon, cumin,
pepper, and saffron. Chilies were unknown in the Eastern Hemisphere in
the pre-modern era.

Peasant recreation might include ball games, wrestling, and, of course,
drinking. Beer was northern Europe's most common drink, while in
southern Europe, people drank wine. The best quality wines were a
luxury, with nobles throughout Europe drinking the wines of Italy and
southern France. Due to the warm medieval climate, vineyards thrived in
England as well.

Noble recreation included chess (introduced from the Muslim world around
the eleventh century), hunting (usually forbidden to peasants), and the
**tournament**. During a tournament, knights would form into teams and
fight each other, sometimes with blunted weapons (and sometimes not),
relying on their armor to protect them. Accidental fatalities in hunting
and tournaments were common.

Europe's growing cities had narrow, unpaved streets with pools of waste,
through which pigs, dogs, and other animals would wander. Paris, whose
streets King Philip Augustus ordered paved and lined with ditches, was
the exception rather than the rule. Likewise, although London had a
network of pipes to carry water from springs by 1236, the inhabitants of
most cities got water from wells, and these were often contaminated.
Indeed, the disease from parasites and contaminated water meant that
cities were **population sinks**, where more people died than were born.
Their population increased largely because of people migrating from the
countryside. By the twelfth century, most towns of Western Europe
recognized a runaway serf as legally free if he or she had resided
within the walls of a town for a year and a day.

Medieval Europe remained a patriarchal culture. The division of labor in
peasant, middleclass, and noble households, however, meant that women
played an active part in economic life. Women peasants would often labor
alongside men in the fields, and women often ran taverns. Likewise,
among nobles, women usually managed the household and sometimes directed
the economic activity of the great agricultural estates.

But women remained subordinate. Although they could be nuns, women could
not be ordained as clergy. Legally, a woman was subordinate to her
husband. And even though nobles increasingly read love poetry that
placed women in a position of honor and devotion, this very devotion
emphasized the woman as a prize rather than as a partner.

## 12.22 FOURTEENTH-CENTURY CRISES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

As the thirteenth century drew to a close, Europe began to run into its
**Malthusian limits**---i.e., how many people the land could support
before food ran short. At the same time, the previously warm climate
began to change. The Medieval Warm Period gave way to the **Little Ice
Age**, which brought cooler temperatures to the Northern Hemisphere from
1300 to 1850. Climate change made conditions less suitable for
agriculture; famine returned to Europe.

Between 1315 and 1322, a set of extremely rainy, wet summers caused
crops to fail, resulting in massive famines and starvation. Accounts
written at the time speak of castle walls being washed away in flood
waters. At the same time, livestock throughout Western Europe died in
droves from outbreaks of Rinderpest, Anthrax, and other diseases. Many
peasants starved. Many more suffered from malnutrition. Contemporary
accounts refer to hungry peasants resorting to cannibalism. Like other
crops, cash crops also failed, so that those who did survive were
poorer.

Scarcely a generation had passed after the Great Famine when Europe was
hit by a global pandemic: the Black Death. The **Black Death** was
almost certainly an outbreak of Bubonic Plague, caused by the bacterium
*Yersina* *pestis*. This disease has an extremely high mortality
rate---certain varieties can have a mortality rate of over ninety-nine
percent, and even the more survivable varieties usually kill the
majority of the infected. The Plague acts in three ways. The variety
called Bubonic Plague results in painful, swollen lumps around the
armpits, crotch, and neck (locations associated with the lymph nodes);
when they burst, a foul-smelling pus emerges. The septicemic variety
results in skin turning black and dying all over the body. The pneumonic
variety---almost always fatal---shows no visible symptoms but affects
the lungs and can cause a victim to go from healthy to dead in the space
of twenty-four hours.

The pandemic began in the Yuan Empire (see Chapter Eleven).
Unfortunately for the rest of the world, the trade routes opened by the
Mongols meant that not only could ideas and technology travel but
disease as well. The Plague began in East and Central Asia, but it
quickly spread to the Middle East and North Africa, to the Swahili
Coast, and eventually to Western Europe.

Its impacts were calamitous. A little over half of Europe's population
died. After the first outbreak of the Plague, between 1347 and 1351,
less virulent outbreaks continued to strike Europe nearly every year
until 1782. Europe's population began a long decline; it did not start
recovering until the fifteenth century. It did not return to its
pre-Plague levels until the seventeenth (and in some regions, the
eighteenth) century. Casualty rates among clergy were as high as sixty
percent. Some monastic houses had casualty rates as high as ninety-nine
percent, as monks living in communal environments were more likely to
spread disease.

In the aftermath of the Plague, however, living conditions for surviving
peasants improved in many ways. Because there were fewer people, those
who survived had access to more lands and resources. In addition, the
need to find peasants to work the land forced nobles to offer better
wages and living conditions. As a result, peasant wages rose and serfdom
in Western Europe gradually vanished. In some kingdoms, monarchs and
their assemblies attempted to create legislation to reinforce the low
social status of the peasantry, but these efforts were often
unsuccessful. This failure to maintain pre-existing status distinctions
stood in contrast to Mamluk Egypt. In the aftermath of the Plague,
Egypt's ruling class of largely Turkic Mamluks managed to keep the
peasantry in a firmly subordinate role and prevent the rise of peasant
wages.

## 12.23 WAR {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Famine and disease were not the only disasters to strike late medieval
Europe. The fourteenth century also saw an increase in both civil wars
and wars between states. The Holy Roman Empire saw nearly a decade of
civil war (1314--1326) between rival emperors. Sweden, Denmark, and
Norway also experienced frequent combinations of civil and interstate
war until the 1397 Union of Kalmar brought the three together under one
crown.

</figure>

The longest-running of these wars was between England and France, the
so-called **Hundred Years' War** (1337--1453). In 1328, the French king
Charles IV died without a direct heir. England's king, Edward III (r.
1327--1377), related to the French royal family, claimed to be rightful
heir to the crown of France. The resulting war lasted over a century,
although it was broken by frequent, lengthy truces. Although France had
many more people than England, England was often victorious on the
battlefield. The main reason was that English kings made increasing use
of trained, disciplined infantry armies. Horseback cavalry are effective
in battle against raiders or other horsemen. They are less effective
when infantry present a solid front and strike from a distance with
missile weapons. Using a combination of archers and infantry, the
English were able to inflict severe defeats on the French at both Crécy
(26 August 1346) and Poitiers (19 September 1356).

The war was particularly hard on the civilians of the French
countryside: the method of waging war of a pre-modern army often
involved invading enemy territory and burning crops, looting villages,
and murdering civilians. French peasants, who had suffered first from
the Plague and then from war, rose in rebellion in 1358, but this
rebellion was ruthlessly crushed, with the peasants slaughtered and
leaders brutally executed.

The Hundred Years' War would spill over into Spain, which itself was
suffering from a vicious war between Castile and Aragon. Eventually,
this caused a Castilian civil war, with both French and English
intervening.

The wars of the fourteenth and especially fifteenth century saw not only
an increasing use of trained, professional armies but also the
employment of gunpowder weapons, invented in Song China and first seen
in Europe in the early 1300s. At first, firearms were limited to heavy,
cumbersome artillery pieces that were deployed from fixed points. Their
use on the battlefield and in sieges was limited. By the fifteenth
century, though, cannons could blast open the gates of most existing
fortifications. By the mid-1400s, the harquebus, a man-transportable
firearm, appeared on the battlefield in Spain, bringing gunpowder to the
individual infantryman.

## 12.24 SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE IN THE LATE MIDDLE AGES {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, the restored Byzantine Empire was unable
to fully re-establish itself---even as a regional power in the Aegean.
The warring Italian city-states of Genoa and Venice controlled many of
the best ports of the Aegean and Black Sea. A new Turkic power, the
Ottomans, was rising in Central Anatolia in the aftermath of the Mongol
destruction of the Saljuq sultanate. Emperor Andronikos II (r.
1282--1328) hired a company of mercenaries from the region of Spain
called Catalonia to shore up Byzantine defenses in Anatolia. The Catalan
Company won some victories against the Turks, but it turned on the
Byzantines and established a state in Athens that would last for seventy
years. By 1331, with the failure of the Catalan Company, nearly all
Byzantine territory in Asia Minor fell under Turkish rule. Shortly
thereafter, the nascent Ottoman Empire began expanding into southeastern
Europe.

The disintegration of the Byzantine state allowed the Serbian and
Bulgarian Empires to flourish in the fourteenth century. Their cultures
emerged as a melding of both Greek and Slavic elements, which created a
unique synthesis of cultures and institutions. In the end, though, these
Empires would eventually be overwhelmed by the Turks, with the Ottomans
conquering Serbia between 1389 and 1459 and Bulgaria in 1396. But even
as the Byzantine state crumbled, intellectual activity flourished in the
Orthodox Church. Greek intellectuals of the fourteenth century sought to
engage with the thought of Aquinas and experiment with new forms of
prayer and meditation.

In the end, Ottoman power swept away all resistance---Bulgar, Serbian,
and Byzantine. In 1453, the Turkish army conquered Constantinople. After
two thousand years, the last remnant of the Roman Empire was gone. In
the meantime, though, the fall of the Byzantine Empire would eventually
contribute to Europe's Renaissance.

## 12.25 THE LATE MEDIEVAL PAPACY {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In 1250, the papacy looked like it was at its high point. After nearly
two centuries of struggle, the popes had definitively broken the power
of the Holy Roman Empire. Within less than a century, however, the power
and prestige of the papacy would be heavily damaged.

The first major blow came when Pope Boniface VIII (r. 1294--1303)
clashed with King Philip IV (r. 1285--1314) of France. When King Philip
attempted to tax French clergy, Pope Boniface resisted strongly,
claiming that a king had no right to tax any clergy. Boniface also
asserted that all earthly authority was subordinate to the authority of
the popes, who were rightful lords of the earth. This conflict ended
when King Philip sent a gang of mercenaries to kidnap and abuse the
pope. Even though Boniface himself escaped, he died of the shock shortly
thereafter.

</figure>

To avoid further antagonizing the French crown, the College of Cardinals
(the churchmen who elect the pope) elected a Frenchman to succeed him as
pope: Clement V (r. 1305--1314). Clement, however, never took up
residence in Rome. In 1309, he settled the papal court in Avignon, a
city owned by the papacy which sat just across the border of the Kingdom
of France. To many observers at the time, it looked as though the papacy
had been relocated to France under the thumb of the French monarchy.

The Italian poet Petrarch referred to the period when the papacy resided
at Avignon as the **Babylonian Captivity of the Church**. He was
referring metaphorically to the account in the Old Testament of the
Bible in which the people of Judaea were held captive in the city of
Babylon. Petrarch was insinuating that God's community was now held
captive in a foreign land rather than occupying Rome, the city of St.
Peter and the popes for 1,300 years.

</figure>

The crisis would only grow worse. In 1377, Pope Gregory XI (r.
1370--1378) moved the papal court back to Rome. At his death, the
cardinals, pressured by an angry Roman mob, elected Urban VI, an
Italian. Urban, however, proved to be erratic and abusive, so many
cardinals fled Rome to Avignon, where they elected another pope. The
result was that the Catholic world now had two popes, each one claiming
to be the rightful representative of Jesus Christ on earth. This period,
lasting from 1378 to 1417, is known as the **Great Schism**. It resulted
in a divided church, with different bishops following different popes. A
1409 council convened to depose both popes and appoint a single pope
instead resulted in three popes, as neither Rome nor the Avignon papacy
recognized this new pope.

The conflict was resolved with the **Council of Constance**
(1415--1417), which deposed all three popes and selected a new one. The
prestige of the papacy, however, had been tarnished. The popes spent
much of the later fifteenth century attempting to rebuild the Church's
authority and prestige, although whether they would fully succeed
remained to be seen.

## 12.26 THE EUROPEAN RENAISSANCE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

The **Italian Renaissance** was an intellectual movement whose ideals
were to return to the art, literature, and culture of Ancient Greece and
Rome. Indeed, the word "renaissance" comes from the French word for
"rebirth." No intellectual movement can be traced to a single cause. If
we look to the Mediterranean world of the fourteenth century, though, we
can find at least a few causes of the Renaissance.

Northern Italy was well-suited for the emergence of the Renaissance.
Thanks to Mediterranean trade, it was one of the wealthiest and most
urbanized regions of Western Europe. It was also politically fragmented.
This meant that the princes of its many courts all offered sponsorship
to artists and intellectuals. Italy's education system had also focused
more on the literature of Ancient Rome than the rest of Europe, whose
scholastic curriculum often focused on logic and philosophy.

In this environment, the Italian poet Francesco Petrarch's (1307--1374)
writings prompted a greater interest in the literature of Ancient Rome.
This focus on studying literature rather than philosophy and theology is
often known as **humanism**, since poetry and literature were called
humanistic studies in medieval schools. Another key element of the
humanistic movement was that its proponents believed in studying the
ancient texts themselves rather than the centuries of commentaries that
had grown up around these texts. This emphasis on using original texts
encouraged further study of Latin language and how it had changed over
time.

Originally, humanistic scholars had focused on the study of Latin. But
other circumstances soon brought about a greater emphasis on the study
of Greek. As the Byzantine Empire crumbled before the Ottoman Turks,
many Greek-speaking refugees settled in Italy, particularly in the
city-state of Florence. These refugees brought Greek books with them and
founded schools for the study of Greek.

<figure id="attachment_541" class="wp-caption aligncenter"

</figure>

In Western Europe, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the
fifth century, the study of Greek had declined. As a result, most
readers only knew of the literature of Ancient Greece through Latin
summaries. By the twelfth century, Western Europeans had read the
philosophy of Aristotle and the science of Ptolemy---but usually only in
translation. Often, that meant such works were translated from Greek to
Arabic to Latin. A return to the study of Greek meant that scholars were
now reading Greek literature in its original language. Manuel
Chrysoloras (c. 1350--1415) established a school for the study of Greek
in Florence. Western Europeans now had direct access to most of the
writings of Plato and Homer for the first time in centuries.

This interest in the culture of the ancient world also led to an
interest in the art and architecture of Greece and Rome. Churches, such
as Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence (built between 1420 and 1436),
sprang up in imitation of the domed temples (and churches) of ancient
Rome. Meanwhile, sculptors such as Donatello (1386--1466) produced
naturalistic sculptures, the likes of which had not been seen in more
than a thousand years. This intellectual movement was not simply an
affair of scholars and artists. Indeed, its impacts would be
far-reaching throughout Western Europe. The children of princes and
wealthy merchants gradually came to be educated along humanistic lines,
and the fashion for a humanistic education would eventually spread from
Italy to the elites of all Western Europe.

Humanism's political impacts would be broad as well. Since the eighth
century, the popes had relied on the text of the Donation of Constantine
in their struggles with the Holy Roman Empire and to demonstrate their
right to rule as earthly princes. In 1440, the humanist scholar Lorenzo
Valla (1407--1457) analyzed the Donation of Constantine---and showed
definitively that it was a forgery. Its Latin writing style was most
certainly *not* the Latin of fourth-century Rome. Valla had shown that
one of the foundational documents by which the papacy claimed legitimacy
as an earthly power was a fraud.

Even the ideals of how a ruler should govern came under the influence of
Renaissance humanism. In his analysis of the historical writings of
Ancient Rome, the humanist Niccolò Machiavelli (1469--1527) argued that
the circumstances of history show that a prince should not necessarily
attempt to rule virtuously but instead ruthlessly set aside ethics and
morality to accomplish the goals of the state. One should note that in
many ways, rulers already behaved this way, but Machiavelli gave an
intellectual justification for doing so.

And, of course, an intense study of the language of ancient texts led to
an intense study of the ancient text that was most important for late
medieval Europe: the Bible. Humanists such as the Dutch scholar
Desiderius Erasmus (1469--1536) used the tools of linguistic
investigation to analyze the Greek text of the New Testament. Other
scholars also began looking at the Bible not with the intellectual tools
of logic and philosophy but with linguistic analysis. They began to
examine the text as it had been written---not as it had been interpreted
for the last 1,400 years. The results of such efforts were explosive.

## 12.27 STATES IN THE LATE MIDDLE AGES AND RENAISSANCE {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

As Europe transitioned into the fifteenth century, two of Europe's most
organized states remained locked in destructive warfare. England's king
Henry V (r. 1413--1422) came close to conquering all of France, aided
largely by the fact that France itself was riven by a civil war between
two powerful houses of nobles, the Armagnacs and Burgundians.
Eventually, France's rival houses ended their differences. The unified
nation was able to expel English troops using trained and disciplined
infantry funded by a centralized apparatus of taxation. The Hundred
Years' War thus ended in 1453. England's loss in France was followed by
a civil war in England, which lasted from 1455 to 1485. We call this the
**Wars of the Roses** because the rival factions used red and white
roses as their emblems. This conflict would eventually place the Tudor
dynasty on the English throne.

In Northern Italy, at the same time as the brilliant artistic
achievements of the Italian Renaissance, the city-states of Italy were
locked in near-continual warfare. The 1454 Treaty of Lodi brought almost
half a century of peace to the Italian peninsula. That peace would come
to an end, however, in 1494, when King Charles VIII of France (r.
1483--1498) turned the power of the newly consolidated French state to
an invasion of Italy. The cannons used by the French army effortlessly
battered the medieval walls of Italian cities and castles. A new era of
warfare was beginning.

## 12.28 IBERIA AND THE ATLANTIC: NEW WORLDS {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

In the southwest of Europe, events in Iberia would usher in the end of
Europe's Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times.

Portugal, Castile, and Aragon were steeped in the traditions of the
*Reconquista*, of expanding the dominion of the Christian world by force
of arms. The *Reconquista* had established a habit in the Iberian
kingdoms of conquering Muslims lands and reducing their Muslim and
Jewish inhabitants to subordinate status (or in some cases to outright
slavery). By the fifteenth century, these kingdoms had nearly completed
the *Reconquista*. Only Granada remained under Muslim rule.

Meanwhile, over the fourteenth century, both Venice and the Ottoman
Empire had forced the Italian city-state of Genoa out of the Eastern
Mediterranean. Genoese sailors and ship owners turned their focus to the
western half of the Mediterranean Sea. Always on the lookout for new
markets, Genoese merchants knew from trade with the Islamic Maghreb that
West Africa was a source of gold. In 1324, Mansa Musa's *hajj* to Mecca
(see Chapter Nine) had put so much gold into circulation that the price
of gold fell by twenty-five percent in the Mediterranean market. The
Muslim rulers of Morocco controlled the overland routes by which gold
traveled from Mali to the Mediterranean. They did, however, control the
seas. Perhaps certain sailors could bypass the overland route by sailing
around the Sahara, into the Atlantic, and directly to the source of
Africa's gold.

Three technological changes transformed maritime transportation by 1300:
the compass; a map called the **portolan** (which could accurately
represent coastlines); and ships that operated by sail rather than oar
(requiring fewer sailors). The combination of these three meant that
European navigators could begin venturing into open waters of the ocean
that the Arabs and Ancient Romans had largely avoided.

Genoese merchants began tentatively sailing into the Atlantic. In the
early 1300s, they regularly visited the Canary Islands. These merchants
increasingly served in the employ of Iberian kings. In 1404, King Henry
III of Castile (r. 1390--1406) began Spanish efforts to conquer the
Canaries and convert their indigenous peoples to Christianity. Over the
next century, the Spanish would conquer and settle the islands, driven
by the *Reconquista* ideal of the military spread of the Christian
faith. In the mid-fifteenth century, the kingdom of Portugal began the
conquest and colonization of the Azores, nearly 700 miles to the
southwest of Iberia in the Atlantic.

Genoese merchants established sugar plantations on these chains of
islands, and those plantations were worked by slave labor. In the
thirteenth century, Venetian merchants had begun to grow sugar in their
island colonies in the Mediterranean, and labor for these colonies came
from the Mediterranean slave trade. Genoese merchants copied this
economic model first in Sicily and then, when they began to operate in
the Atlantic, in the Canaries and Azores. They would often purchase
slaves for these plantations from Africans on the continent's Atlantic
coast. Thus began a slave trade that would be as lucrative for its
operators as it was brutal for its victims. The lure of African gold
drew mariners serving Iberian monarchs south and west. By 1482, the
Portuguese had established the fort and trading post of São Jorge da
Mina on the coast of Guinea.

In 1479, Queen Isabella of Castile married King Ferdinand II of Aragon.
Their union created a united Spanish kingdom. In 1492, the two monarchs
conquered Granada, the last Muslim territory in Spain. This completed
the *Reconquista*. All of Spain was now under Christian rule, and the
king and queen were eager to continue spreading the Catholic religion.

Ferdinand and Isabella sponsored a voyage by the Genoese sailor
Christopher Columbus. Columbus had miscalculated the size of the world,
so he believed that it would be possible to sail to Asia by traveling
west across the Atlantic Ocean. Contrary to popular belief, European
mariners knew the world was a sphere. They believed, however, that it
was impossible to carry adequate supplies to sail around the world due
to the sheer distance between Europe and Asia. When Columbus made
landfall in 1492, it was not in East Asia. He had, in fact, been wrong,
drastically underestimating the size of the world. Rather, he made
landfall in a set of lands previously unknown to the peoples of the
Eastern Hemisphere. The world was about to be forever changed.

## 12.29 CONCLUSION {.import-Header2 style="margin-left: 0pt;"}

Over the eleventh and twelfth centuries, a rise in agricultural
production led to an increase in Western Europe's wealth and population.
The chaos of the tenth and eleventh centuries brought about the origin
of a feudal system dominated by knights. Feudal Europe was thus able to
respond to the Byzantine Empire's requests for help when its field army
was annihilated by Saljuq Turks, resulting in the First Crusade and
establishment of a set of Crusader States in the Eastern Mediterranean.
These Crusader states were gradually conquered by Muslim powers over the
next two centuries. An army of Crusaders would eventually defeat and
break up the Byzantine Empire. Although that empire would be
re-established, it was never strong enough to resist the pressure of the
Ottoman Turks, who finally conquered it in 1453.

As Western Europe grew in population and urbanization, the urban
cathedral schools became the center of an increase in intellectual
activity known as the Twelfth-Century Renaissance. Thinkers of the
Twelfth-Century Renaissance used the philosophy of the Ancient Greeks
and Arabs to understand the world, and in the thirteenth century, the
intellectual movement known as scholasticism would seek to reconcile
Christianity with Arabic and Ancient Greek Philosophy. By the end of the
Middle Ages, Europe's intellectuals would seek to study the writings of
the Ancient Greeks and Romans, and not the commentaries of the previous
thousand years. This movement was known as Renaissance humanism.

Europe's states---with the notable exception of the Holy Roman
Empire---gradually consolidated, but the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries saw increasing interstate warfare. The states that emerged out
of this endemic war, however, were more militarily powerful and more
centralized. At the same time, sailors in the service of Spain and
Portugal explored the Atlantic and West Africa until the close of the
fifteenth century, when Western Europeans discovered the existence of
the continents of the Western Hemisphere.

## Chapter 1. Prehistory

We begin our study rightly at the beginning of mankind. In this module,
we will investigate the evolution of man as far back as 8 million years
ago to *homo sapiens*. Moving out of Africa, modern humans populated the
world during the Paleolithic Era and ultimately forever changed society
during the Neolithic Era. Around 8,000 BCE, the development of
agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution will have intended and
unintended consequences. This fascinating time in history demonstrates
how humans interact with their environment. In this episode, Dr. Juliet
Brophy of Louisiana State University joins Lise Namikas.

## Chapter 2. Early Middle Eastern and Northeast African Civilizations

The first civilizations we will discuss will be Egypt, Mesopotamia, and
Nubia. Egypt will be relatively protected, and there will not be much
political unrest. Mesopotamia, however, will not be so lucky; we see
continuous turmoil in Mesopotamia. Religion was foundational for each
early civilization, and we will see varying degrees of rights for women.

## Chapter 5. The Greek World from the Bronze Age to the Roman Conquest

The Greeks have been considered the cornerstone of Western civilization.
This is true in many respects. Both democracy and philosophy come from
the Greeks. We also owe the study of history to the Greeks. The Greeks
were humanity-centered.

As for dates, the peak of ancient Greece is generally considered around
450 BCE (the Delian League), and the civilization generally closes
around 323 BCE (the death of Alexander the Great). Much of what the
Greeks accomplished will not end with the downfall of Athens and Sparta
because of Alexander the Great. He will create a massive empire.
Alexander is one of the most intriguing figures in history. He has
become a legend, and distinguishing fact from fiction has become
difficult, even for historians. Alexander is given credit for extending
Greek culture throughout the world. Much of Greek society will continue
through the Roman Empire and will be reborn again with the Renaissance.

## Chapter 6. The Roman World from 753 BCE to 500 CE

Rome wasn't built in a day. The Roman Republic (and later, the Roman
Empire) was built on many of the achievements of its neighbors in the
Mediterranean region---especially Greece. Rome struggled to address the
challenges of governing a large area (and population), but its
innovations in politics and religion continue to influence our world
today. The fall of (Western) Rome in 476 AD (CE) has long served as a
reminder of how quickly our world can change.

## Chapter 7. Western Europe and Byzantium circa 500--1000 CE

Were the Dark Ages really that dark? Many things changed in Europe after
the fall of (Western) Rome in 476 AD (CE). Governments broke down.
People moved to the countryside. Cities fell into ruin. Engineering and
architectural skills were forgotten. Raiding and warfare were common.
But the early Middle Ages prepared the way for the emergence of new
social and political structures in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance
era. And, in the eastern city of Constantinople, the Roman Empire
survived for another 1000 years.

## Chapter 8. Islam to the Mamluks

The Islamic world began in Arabia and grew with the vision of the
Prophet Muhammad. The chapter outlines Muhammad's experiences and the
origins of Islam. It identifies the basic characteristics of Islam, its
five pillars, community, and social aspects. The chapter then explains
the growth and expansion of Islam, its empire building and conquest. It
explains the empire building of Muhammad and then those who followed,
specifically the Umayyads and the Abbasids. Salwa and Saif Saeed,
Louisiana Delta Community College students, join Lise Namikas in this
episode. Lise interviews Linda Midgett, independent director and
producer of 2018 film: Same God.

## Chapter 9. African History to 1500

African civilizations are more diverse than anywhere else in the world.
Yet the general, western understanding of Africa is slim. Africa has
faced a number of environmental challenges that have limited population
growth, but it has still fostered great empires such as those in
Ethiopia (Aksum), the Western Sudanic empires, and south Africa. In this
episode, Lise Namikas interviews Prince Lobo, owner/manager of Addis
Nola restaurant in New Orleans, Louisiana.

## Chapter 10. The Americas

This module will explore the history of the Americas through the
examination of the various groups of people who settled the continent.
This module begins with an introduction into the migration of people
across the Bering Strait to North America. The learner will examine the
three major civilizations of the Americas, the Maya, the Aztecs, and the
Inca.

## Chapter 11. Central Asia

The Mongols were a unique force in world history. As nomadic
pastoralists, they still created major and impactful empires. Beginning
with Genghis Khan, the Mongols moved west into South Asia, the middle
east, and the lands of Rus, as well as founding the Yuan empire in
China. They blended with the Turkic peoples, lead with a brutal form of
conquest, and gradually adopted Islam and settled more permanently.

## Chapter 12. Western Europe and Byzantium circa 1000--1500 CE

The Renaissance draws together many of the topics discussed in this
class. The period was defined by new interest in the culture of ancient
Greece and Rome, as can be seen in the art of Leonardo da Vinci and
Michelangelo. The Renaissance also encouraged scientific inquiry and
exploration, often using ancient works preserved by medieval Christian
and Islamic scribes. In the end, Renaissance sailors and navigators
reconnected Europe to Africa and Asia and ultimately to the Americas.
When Columbus crossed the Atlantic in 1492, his voyage did more than
connect two hemispheres: it symbolized the end of one era and the
beginning of another.
